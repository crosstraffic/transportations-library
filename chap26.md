### **1. INTRODUCTION**

Chapter 26 is the supplemental chapter for Chapter 12, Basic Freeway
and Multilane Highway Segments, and Chapter 15, Two-Lane Highways,
which are found in Volume 2 of the _Highway Capacity Manual_ (HCM).

Section 2 provides state-specific heavy-vehicle default values that can be
applied to freeway, multilane highway, and two-lane highway analysis.

Section 3 presents a supplemental procedure for basic freeway segments
that can be used to assess their operating performance under mixed-flow
conditions when significant truck presence, a prolonged single upgrade, or
both exist. Appendix A provides travel time versus distance curves for
single-unit trucks (SUTs) and tractor-trailers (TTs) for a range of free-flow
speeds (FFS) for use with this procedure. Chapter 25, Freeway Facilities:
Supplemental, presents an extension of this method for composite grades on
freeway facilities.

Section 4 provides suggested capacity and FFS adjustments to account
for the effects of different proportions of motorists on a freeway or multilane
highway who are not regular users of the facility.

Section 5 presents freeway capacity definitions, guidance on locating
sensors for use in measuring freeway capacity, and guidance on estimating
capacity from the collected sensor data.

Section 6 provides guidance on incorporating the potential freeway
capacity benefits of connected and automated vehicles into an HCM analysis.

Section 7 provides seven example problems demonstrating the basic
freeway and multilane highway segment procedure presented in Chapter 12.

Section 8 provides five example problems demonstrating the motorized
vehicle and bicycle methodologies for two-lane highways presented in
Chapter 15.


Appendix B describes a methodology for calculating capacity and related
performance measures for work zones along two-lane highways that involve
the closure of a single lane.


### **2. STATE-SPECIFIC HEAVY-VEHICLE DEFAULT VALUES**

Research into the percentage of heavy vehicles on uninterrupted-flow
facilities ( _1_ ) found such a wide range of average values from state to state
that not even regional default values could be developed. Exhibit 26-1
presents default values for the percentage of heavy vehicles on freeways by
state and area population based on data from the 2004 Highway Performance
Monitoring System. Exhibit 26-2 presents similar default values for multilane
and two-lane highways. In cases in which states or local jurisdictions have
developed their own default values, those values should be used in lieu of
the values presented here. Analysts may also wish to develop their own
default values based on local or more recent data.

### **3. TRUCK ANALYSIS USING THE MIXED-FLOW** **MODEL**

**INTRODUCTION**

This section presents a supplemental procedure that can be used to assess
the operating performance of freeway segments under mixed-flow conditions
when significant truck presence, a prolonged single upgrade, or both exist.
This procedure _must_ be used if the analyst is interested in estimating space
mean speeds and densities for cars and trucks separately or for the mixedtraffic stream.

Chapter 12, Basic Freeway and Multilane Highway Segments, describes
a methodology drawn from this procedure that can be used to assess a
segment’s level of service (LOS) by converting heavy vehicles into
passenger cars by using passenger car equivalent (PCE) values. However,
users are cautioned that the auto-only speeds and densities estimated by the
PCE-based procedure are likely to be an approximation of reality at high
truck percentages and on steep upgrades. For these situations, the mixed-flow
model described here is recommended.

Analysts can also use the mixed-flow model for analyzing downgrades
and both types of general terrain (level and rolling). When the truck
percentage is low or the upgrade is not steep, both the mixed-flow model and
the Chapter 12 PCE-based method provide similar results. Chapter 25,
Freeway Facilities: Supplemental, extends the mixed-flow model to freeway
facilities with multiple, composite grades. National research ( _2_ ) shows that
when the truck presence is low or the upgrade is not steep, both the mixedflow model and the procedure applying PCE values provide similar results.


**OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY**

The process flow for applying the mixed-flow model is depicted in
Exhibit 26-3. Selected parameters referenced in the methodology are


indicated in Exhibit 26-4 for a 70-mi/h auto-only traffic stream and a
representative mixed-traffic stream.


**Exhibit 26-3: Overview of Operational Analysis Methodology for Mixed-Flow Model**


Notes: SUT = single-unit truck; TT = tractor-trailer; FFS = free-flow speed; MFM = mixedflow model.


**Exhibit 26-4: Speed–Flow Models for 70-mi/h Auto-Only Flow and a Representative**
**Mixed Flow**


Notes: BP = breakpoint; FFS = free-flow speed; c = capacity.


**Step 1: Input Data**

For a typical operational analysis, the analyst must specify the flow rate
of the mixed-traffic stream _v_ mix, grade _g_, grade length _d_, SUT percentage
_PSUT_, and TT percentage _PTT_ for the traffic stream.


**Step 2: Compute Mixed-Flow Capacity Adjustment Factor and**
**Capacity**

The capacity adjustment factor (CAF) for mixed-flow _CAF_ mix converts
auto-only capacities into mixed-traffic capacities. It is computed with


Equation 26-1.


**Equation 26-1:**


where

_CAF_ mix = mixed-flow capacity adjustment factor for the basic freeway
segment (decimal);

_CAFao_ = capacity adjustment factor for the auto-only case (decimal);

_CAFT,_ mix = capacity adjustment factor for percentage of trucks for the
mixed-flow case (decimal); and

_CAFg,_ mix = capacity adjustment factor for grade for the mixed-flow case
(decimal).


_CAF for the Auto-Only Case_

Because _CAFao_ is used to convert auto-only capacities into mixed-traffic
capacities, it defaults to a value of 1.0 unless other capacity adjustments are
in effect (e.g., weather, incidents, driver population factor).


_CAF for Truck Percentage_

The CAF for truck percentage _CAFT,_ mix is computed with Equation 26-2.


**Equation 26-2:**


where _PT_ is the total percentage of SUTs and TTs in the traffic stream
(decimal).


_CAF for Grade Effect_


The CAF for grade effect _CAFg,_ mix accounts for the grade severity, grade
length, and truck presence. It is computed by using Equation 26-3 with
Equation 26-3.


**Equation 26-3:**


with


**Equation 26-4:**


where

_ρg,_ mix = coefficient for grade term in the mixed-flow CAF equation
(decimal),

_PT_ = total truck percentage (decimal),

_g_ = grade (decimal), and

_d_ = grade length (mi).


Once _CAF_ mix is computed, the mixed-flow capacity can be computed
with Equation 26-5.


**Equation 26-5:**


where

_C_ mix = mixed-flow capacity (veh/h/ln);


_Cao_ = auto-only capacity for the given FFS, from Exhibit 12-6
(pc/h/ln); and

_CAF_ mix = mixed-flow capacity adjustment factor for the basic freeway
segment (decimal).


If the input flow rate of the mixed-traffic stream _v_ mix exceeds the mixedflow capacity computed in Equation 26-5, then LOS F prevails, and the
segment procedure stops. A facility analysis is recommended under these
conditions.


**Step 3: Compute Mixed-Flow FFS and FFS Adjustment Factor**

Equation 26-6 through Equation 26-8 compute the free-flow travel rates
(in seconds per mile) for SUTs, TTs, and automobiles, respectively, for a
specific segment with a steep grade, high truck percentage, or both. For the
purposes of calculating the automobile free-flow travel rate, the flow rate of
the mixed-traffic stream _v_ mix is assumed to be 1 veh/h/ln when Equation 26-8
is used.


**Equation 26-6:**


**Equation 26-7:**


**Equation 26-8:**


where

_τa_ = automobile free-flow travel rate (s/mi),

_τSUT_ = SUT free-flow travel rate (s/mi),

_τTT_ = TT free-flow travel rate (s/mi),

_τSUT,kin_ = kinematic travel rate of SUTs (s/mi),

_τTT,kin_ = kinematic travel rate of TTs (s/mi),

_ΔτTI_ = traffic interaction term (s/mi),

_v_ mix = flow rate of mixed traffic (veh/h/ln),

_FFS_ = base free-flow speed of the basic freeway segment (mi/h),

_PSUT_ = SUT percentage (decimal),

_PTT_ = TT percentage (decimal), and

3,600 = number of seconds in 1 h.


_Traffic Interaction Term_

The traffic interaction term computed by Equation 26-9 is the
contribution of traffic interactions to mixed-flow FFS. For the purposes of
calculating the automobile free-flow travel rate, the traffic interaction term
_ΔτTI_ is set to 0 when Equation 26-8 is used.


**Equation 26-9:**


where



_ΔτTI_ = traffic interaction term (s/mi);



_Sao_ = auto-only speed for the given flow rate, from Equation 26-10
(mi/h);



_FFS_ = base free-flow speed of the basic freeway segment (mi/h);
and



_CAF_ mix = mixed-flow capacity adjustment factor for the basic freeway
segment from Equation 26-1 (decimal).



_Auto-Only Speed for the Given Flow Rate_



The auto-only travel rate for the given flow rate is computed with
Equation 26-10.

_c_ = base segment capacity, from Exhibit 12-6 (pc/h/ln);



_BPao_ = breakpoint for the auto-only flow condition, from Exhibit 126 (pc/h/ln);



_Dc_ = density at capacity = 45 pc/mi/ln; and



_CAF_ mix = mixed-flow capacity adjustment factor for the basic freeway
segment, from Equation 26-1 (decimal).


_Kinematic Travel Rates for SUTs and TTs_

The kinematic travel rates for SUTs and TTs are obtained from truck
travel time versus distance performance curves on the basis of the truck
weight-to-horsepower ratio, grade, and grade length. Exhibit 26-5 shows
truck travel time versus distance curves for a representative SUT starting
from a speed of 70 mi/h. Alternate representations of how the propulsive and
resistive forces vary with speed can produce slightly different results (e.g.,
_3_, _4_ ).

Exhibit 26-6 shows the corresponding curves for TTs for a base FFS of
70 mi/h. These curves can be used when the base FFS is within 2.5 mi/h of
70 mi/h. Appendix A provides additional curves for SUTs and TTs for FFS
values of 50, 55, 60, 65, and 75 mi/h.

On downgrades, trucks are able to maintain their FFS, and their
kinematic performance is the same as passenger cars. The analyst could use
the Chapter 12 PCE-based method instead of the mixed-flow model in those
cases.


**Exhibit 26-5: SUT Travel Time Versus Distance Curves for 70-mi/h FFS**


Note: Curves in this graph assume a weight-to-horsepower ratio of 100.


**Exhibit 26-6: TT Travel Time Versus Distance Curves for 70-mi/h FFS**


Note: Curves in this graph assume a weight-to-horsepower ratio of 150.


The _x_ -axis in Exhibit 26-5 and Exhibit 26-6 represents the distance _d_
traveled by the truck, and the _y_ -axis represents the travel time _T_ to cover the
grade length _d._ Different curves provide the travel times for different
upgrades. The kinematic space mean travel rate can be computed with
Equation 26-11.


**Equation 26-11:**


where

_τkin_ = kinematic travel rate (s/mi),

_T_ = travel time (s), and

_d_ = grade length (mi).


The maximum grade length shown in Exhibit 26-5 and Exhibit 26-6 is
10,000 ft. When the grade is longer than 10,000 ft, the kinematic travel rate
can be computed with Equation 26-12.


**Equation 26-12:**


where

_τkin_ = kinematic travel rate (s/mi),

_T_ 10000 = travel time at 10,000 ft (s),

_δ_ = slope of the travel time versus distance curve (s/ft),

_d_ = grade length (mi), and

5,280 = number of feet in 1 mi.


The _δ_ value for SUTs and TTs is shown in Exhibit 26-7 and Exhibit 26-8,
respectively, for different combinations of grade and FFS.

Once _τSUT,kin_ and _τTT,kin_ are obtained, Equation 26-6 and Equation 26-7
can be used to add the traffic interaction term to obtain the truck free-flow
travel rates _τSUT_ and _τTT_ . Equation 26-8 can then be used to compute the
automobile free-flow travel rate _τa_ . Again, the mixed-flow rate _v_ mix is
assumed to be 1 veh/h/ln when Equation 26-8 is used to estimate the
automobile free-flow travel rate.


_Mixed-Flow FFS_

Equation 26-13 converts individual free-flow travel rates by mode into a
mixed-flow free-flow travel rate, and Equation 26-14 then converts the
mixed-flow free-flow travel rate into a mixed-flow FFS.


**Equation 26-13:**


**Equation 26-14:**


where

_τ_ = mixed-flow free-flow travel rate (s/mi),


_τa_ = automobile free-flow travel rate (s/mi),

_τSUT_ = SUT free-flow travel rate (s/mi),

_τTT_ = TT free-flow travel rate (s/mi),

_Pa_ = automobile percentage (decimal),

_PSUT_ = SUT percentage (decimal),

_PTT_ = TT percentage (decimal), and

_FFS_ mix = mixed-flow free-flow speed (mi/h).


_FFS Adjustment Factor_

The segment’s speed adjustment factor (SAF) is estimated with Equation
26-15.


**Equation 26-15:**


where

_SAF_ mix = mixed-flow speed adjustment factor for the basic freeway
segment (decimal),

_FFS_ mix = mixed-flow free-flow speed (mi/h), and

_FFS_ = base free-flow speed of the basic freeway segment (mi/h).


**Step 4: Compute the Speed–Flow Relationship Breakpoint for**
**the Mixed-Flow Model**

The breakpoint is the maximum flow rate up to which speed is
maintained at the adjusted FFS level. It is computed by Equation 26-16 and
is depicted in Exhibit 26-4.


**Equation 26-16:**


where

_BP_ mix = breakpoint for mixed flow (veh/h/ln);

_BPao_ = breakpoint for the auto-only flow condition, from Exhibit 12-6
(pc/h/ln);

_PT_ = total truck percentage (decimal);

_g_ = grade (decimal); and

_d_ = grade length (mi).


**Step 5: Compute Mixed-Flow Speeds at Capacity and 90% of**
**Capacity**

To determine the mixed-flow speeds for the given mixed-flow rate,
mixed-flow speeds at capacity and 90% of capacity are computed for
calibration purposes. This computation, in turn, requires applying Equation
26-6 through Equation 26-8 to calculate individual speeds for SUTs, TTs,
and automobiles, respectively. The equations are applied twice, first
applying the value of _C_ mix as _v_ mix to calculate speed at capacity, and then
applying the value of 0.9 _C_ mix as _v_ mix to calculate speed at 90% of capacity.

The resulting modal travel time rates are converted to modal speeds _Sm_
by using Equation 26-17.


**Equation 26-17:**


where _Sm_ is the speed (mi/h) for mode _m_ (SUT, TT, or automobile), and _τm_ is
the travel time rate (s/mi) for mode _m._

Next, densities for individual modes are computed with Equation 26-18.


**Equation 26-18:**


where _Dm_ is the density (SUT/mi, TT/mi, or pc/mi, depending on the mode)
for mode _m_, _vm_ is the flow rate (SUT/h, TT/h, or pc/h) for mode _m_, and _Sm_ is
the speed (mi/h) for mode _m_ .

Finally, the mixed-flow speed used for calibration _Scalib_ is calculated
with Equation 26-19.


**Equation 26-19:**


Equation 26-19 is applied twice (i.e., two calibration points are needed),
once using _τ_ values at capacity and again using _τ_ values for 90% of capacity.

Mixed-flow travel rates and mixed-flow speeds are calculated with
Equations 26-13 and 26-14 twice (i.e., two calibration points are needed),
once at capacity and once at 90% capacity.


**Step 6: Compute the Exponent for the Mixed-Flow Model**
**Speed–Flow Curve**

The exponent for the speed–flow curve, which describes the rate at
which speed drops as the flow rate increases in the nonlinear portion of the
mixed-flow speed–flow curve (see Exhibit 26-4), is computed with Equation
26-20.


**Equation 26-20:**


where



_φ_ mix = exponent for the speed–flow curve (decimal),



_FFS_ mix = mixed-flow free-flow speed (mi/h),



_Scalib,_ 90 _cap_ = mixed-flow speed at 90% of capacity (mi/h),



_Scalib,cap_ = mixed-flow speed at capacity (mi/h),



_C_ mix = mixed-flow capacity (veh/h/ln), and



_BP_ mix = breakpoint for mixed flow (veh/h/ln).



**Step 7: Compute the Mixed-Flow Speed Under Mixed-Flow**
**Conditions**



The mixed-flow speed for mixed-flow conditions is computed by using
the generic form of the basic freeway segment speed–flow model, as shown
in Equation 26-21.



**Equation 26-21:**

_BP_ mix = breakpoint for mixed flow (veh/h/ln),



_C_ mix = mixed-flow capacity (veh/h/ln), and


_φ_ mix = exponent for the speed–flow curve (decimal).


**Step 8: Compute the Mixed-Flow Density Under Mixed-Flow**
**Conditions**

The mixed-flow density is computed by Equation 26-22.


**Equation 26-22:**


where

_D_ mix = mixed-flow density (veh/mi/ln),

_v_ mix = flow rate of mixed traffic (veh/h/ln), and

_S_ mix = mixed-flow speed (mi/h).


### **4. ADJUSTMENTS FOR DRIVER POPULATION** **EFFECTS**

The base traffic stream characteristics for basic freeway and multilane
highway segments are representative of traffic streams composed primarily
of commuters or drivers who are familiar with the facility. It is generally
accepted that traffic streams with different characteristics (e.g., recreational
trips) use freeways less efficiently. Although data are sparse and reported
results vary substantially, significantly lower capacities have been reported
on weekends, particularly in recreational areas. Thus, it may generally be
assumed the reduction in capacity extends to service flow rates and service
volumes for other levels of service as well. In addition, it is expected that a
reduction in FFS would be observed when large numbers of unfamiliar
drivers are present in a freeway or multilane highway traffic stream.

The driver population adjustment factor _fp_ has previously been used in
the HCM to reflect the effects of unfamiliar drivers in the traffic stream; it
was applied as an increase in demand volume. The values of _fp_ ranged from
0.85 to 1.00 in most cases, although lower values have been observed in
isolated cases. The HCM recommended the analyst use a value of 1.00 for
this factor (reflecting a traffic stream composed of commuters or other
regular drivers), unless there was sufficient evidence that a lower value
should be used. When greater accuracy was needed, comparative field
studies of commuter and noncommuter traffic flow and speeds were
recommended.

With the addition of a unified speed–flow equation in Chapter 12, Basic
Freeway and Multilane Highway Segments, and the ability to adjust both the
base FFS and capacity in all freeway segment chapters (Chapters 12, 13, and
14) to account for incidents and weather events, the driver population factor
is no longer used. Instead, FFS and capacity adjustment factors _SAFpop_ and
_CAFpop_ are applied in combination with other applicable SAFs and CAFs.


In the absence of new research on driver population effects,
recommended values of _SAFpop_ and _CAFpop_ have been developed that
produce similar density results as those predicted using the former driver
population factor approach. This conversion was performed by using the
unified equation of Chapter 12 and therefore represents a slight
approximation in the cases of weaving, merge, and diverge segments.

Judgment is still required when the analyst applies these adjustments and,
in the absence of information to the contrary, the default value for _SAFpop_ and
_CAFpop_ is always 1.0. Should the analyst expect a significant presence of
unfamiliar drivers, the values shown in Exhibit 26-9 can serve as a guide for
the analysis.


**Exhibit 26-9: Recommended CAF and SAF Adjustments for Driver Population Impacts**


**Level of Driver Familiarity** _**CAFpop**_ _**SAFpop**_
All familiar drivers, regular commuters 1.000 1.000
Mostly familiar drivers 0.968 0.975
Balanced mix of familiar and unfamiliar drivers 0.939 0.950
Mostly unfamiliar drivers 0.898 0.913
All or overwhelmingly unfamiliar drivers 0.852 0.863


### **5. GUIDANCE FOR FREEWAY CAPACITY ESTIMATION**

This section presents guidance for field measuring and estimating
freeway capacity. The section is organized as follows: overall definitions of
freeway capacity, guidance for field data collection using sensors, and
guidance for estimating capacity from the collected data.


**FREEWAY CAPACITY DEFINITIONS**

Freeway segment capacity is commonly understood to be a maximum
flow rate that is associated with the occurrence of some type of breakdown
that in turn results in lower speeds and higher densities after the breakdown
event. When oversaturation begins, queues develop and vehicles discharge
from the bottleneck at a queue discharge rate that is usually lower than the
throughput rate before the breakdown. This lower discharge rate after a
breakdown is also known as the _capacity drop phenomenon._ Several key
terms related to freeway capacity are defined below as they apply to this
chapter.


**Freeway Breakdown**

A flow breakdown on a freeway represents the transition from
uncongested to congested conditions, as evidenced by the formation of
queues upstream of the bottleneck and reduced prevailing speeds.

In the HCM freeway methodology, the breakdown event on a freeway
bottleneck is defined as a sudden drop in speed at least 25% below the FFS
for a sustained period of at least 15 min that results in queuing upstream of
the bottleneck.


**Recovery**

A freeway segment is considered to have recovered from the breakdown
event and the resulting oversaturated conditions when the average speed (or


density) reaches prebreakdown conditions for a minimum duration of 15 min.
The definition of recovery is therefore the inverse of the definition of
breakdown, requiring a recovery to be near prebreakdown conditions
(operations above the speed threshold) for at least 15 min.

The HCM defines the breakdown recovery on a freeway bottleneck as a
return of the prevailing speed to within 10% of the FFS for a sustained
period of at least 15 min, without the presence of queuing upstream of the
bottleneck.


**Prebreakdown Flow Rate**

The prebreakdown flow rate is the flow rate that immediately precedes
the occurrence of a breakdown event. The literature suggests this flow rate
does not have a fixed value, as evidence shows breakdowns are stochastic in
nature and can occur following a range of flow rates. The prebreakdown
flow rate is typically expressed in units of passenger cars per hour per lane.
To achieve a uniform expression, trucks and other heavy vehicles are
converted into an equivalent passenger car traffic stream.

In the HCM, the prebreakdown flow rate is defined as the 15-min
average flow rate that occurs immediately prior to the breakdown event. For
the purposes of this chapter, the prebreakdown flow rate is equivalent to the
segment capacity.


**Postbreakdown Flow Rate or Queue Discharge Flow Rate**

The postbreakdown flow rate is also referred to as the _queue discharge_
_flow rate_ or the average discharge flow rate. This flow rate is usually lower
than the prebreakdown flow rate, resulting in a significant loss of freeway
throughput during congestion. Cases in which the postbreakdown flow rate
exceeds the prebreakdown flow rate have been observed, mostly when the
prebreakdown flow rate is low. Studies ( _5_ ) have indicated the average
difference between postbreakdown and prebreakdown flow rates varies
widely, from as little as 2% to as much as 20%. In the absence of local
information, a default value of 7% is recommended.

In the HCM, the queue discharge flow rate is defined as the average flow
rate during oversaturated conditions (i.e., during the time interval after


breakdown and prior to recovery).


**CAPACITY MEASUREMENT LOCATIONS**

Research at freeway merging segments ( _6_ ) has found a breakdown may
first be observed either upstream or downstream of the actual bottleneck.
Some research has indicated a breakdown may first be observed upstream of
the bottleneck, slowly spreading downstream as vehicles accelerate past the
start of the bottleneck. Other research has found the breakdown initially
occurs downstream of the merge point and then moves upstream as a shock
wave.

To identify the breakdown event from field data, the following process
should be followed:

   - Data are obtained at three sensors: ( _a_ ) a bottleneck location (e.g., just
downstream of the end of the acceleration lane), ( _b_ ) at a nearby
sensor location downstream of the bottleneck, and ( _c_ ) at a nearby
sensor location upstream of the bottleneck.

   - Upstream and downstream sensors should be within 0.5 mi of the
bottleneck, and the freeway ideally should have no entry or exit
points between the three sensors (other than, for example, a
bottleneck on-ramp).

   - The bottleneck detector should be upstream of the beginning of the
deceleration lane or downstream of the end of the acceleration lane to
avoid missing flow in those lanes.

   - The analyst evaluates data from the bottleneck sensor to identify a
breakdown by using the definitions provided above.

   - The analyst evaluates data from the downstream sensor for the same
time period to ensure no breakdown exists, which indicates
congestion at the bottleneck sensor is unlikely due to spillback from
downstream congestion.

   - The analyst evaluates data from the upstream sensor to verify queues
are forming as a result of breakdown at the bottleneck. This check
ensures observed drops in speeds and increases in density at the
bottleneck sensor are indeed due to breakdown.


It is important that the measurements of flows, speeds, and densities used
to estimate capacity are carried out at the correct locations, especially if the
data will be generated from existing fixed freeway sensors, which may or
may not be at the optimal locations to detect breakdown events. Capacity
should always be measured at the bottleneck location. At merge bottlenecks
or lane drops, this location is downstream of the merge point (Exhibit 2610). At diverge bottlenecks, this location is upstream of the diverge point
(Exhibit 26-11). At weaving bottlenecks, this location is within the weaving
area (Exhibit 26-12).

**Exhibit 26-12: Recommended Capacity Measurement Location for Weaving**
**Bottlenecks**


Source: Elefteriadou, Kondyli, and St. George ( _6_ ).


Regardless of the bottleneck type, the analyst will be able to identify and
measure capacity only if a breakdown occurs. As discussed below, the
breakdown event is associated with the development of queues that form
upstream of the bottleneck location (i.e., merge point, diverge point, weaving
section) and propagate further upstream, but queues also propagate
downstream as vehicles accelerate past the start of the bottleneck. Once
breakdown events are identified, the analyst will be able to identify the
prebreakdown and postbreakdown flow rates and estimate segment capacity
based on the method discussed in the next section.


**CAPACITY ESTIMATION FROM FIELD DATA**

To estimate the capacity of the various freeway segments it is important
to analyze data obtained under _recurring_ congestion and under similar
operational and weather conditions. Observations in which adverse weather,
incidents, work zones, or special events were present must be analyzed
separately to obtain capacities under various prevailing conditions. To
obtain a reasonable capacity estimate, it is important to analyze a
considerable amount of data over a period of several months to an entire
year.

The recommended method for capacity estimation from sensor data takes
into account that capacity is stochastic. That is, the same flow rate may or
may not be followed by a breakdown. Therefore, during an observation


period, both prebreakdown flow rates and flow rates that are not followed
by breakdown events (uncongested flow rates) are considered. From these
flow rates, the method develops a capacity distribution and then selects a
capacity value based on an acceptable rate of breakdown. Two plausible
(and equivalent) freeway segment capacity definitions are offered:

1. _Definition A_ : Freeway segment capacity is the maximum 15-min flow
rate (in passenger cars per hour per lane) that produces an acceptable
( _λ_ %) rate of breakdown.

2. _Definition B_ : Freeway segment capacity is the maximum 15-min flow
rate (in passenger cars per hour per lane) that ensures stable flow
(100 – _λ_ %) of the time.

The rate of breakdown _λ_ is the ratio of the total number of periods
observed under prebreakdown conditions, divided by the total number of 15min uncongested observations under the same flow rate. A default acceptable
rate of breakdown _λ_ of 15% is recommended.

The capacity estimation process follows a series of eight steps and
assumes sensors are placed at the appropriate locations (as discussed above)
and are available to measure prebreakdown flows and ensure the absence of
downstream congestion, which may bias the results described below.

1. Record the distribution of 15-min flow rates (in passenger cars per
hour per lane) during the observation period (preferably a long
period). For example, sampling from the sensor 24 h per day on
weekdays over a year gives approximately 24 × 4 × 250 = 24,000
flow rate observations.

2. Exclude the 15-min analysis periods when the freeway is in
breakdown mode, as defined earlier, which will result in a
distribution of uncongested 15-min flow rates. It is recommended to
filter breakdowns due to nonrecurring sources of congestion, such as
severe weather events or incidents, as the focus is on estimating the
bottleneck’s capacity under recurring congestion conditions.

3. Bin the uncongested flow rates into 100- or 200-pc/h/ln bins.

4. Compute the average flow rate in each bin.


5. For each bin, count the number of times the flow rates in the bin were
immediately followed by the occurrence of a breakdown. In other
words, bin the prebreakdown 15-min flow rates.

6. Calculate the actual probability of breakdown _P_ ( _BF_ ) in each bin,
defined as the number of times a flow rate bin was in a
prebreakdown condition _n_ ( _B_ ), divided by the number of times that
bin was observed to have occurred, or _n_ ( _F_ ). The probability of
breakdown _P_ ( _BF_ ) in each bin is simply _P_ ( _BF_ ) = _n_ ( _B_ )/ _n_ ( _F_ ).

7. Fit a Weibull distribution ( _7_ ) to the empirical probability of
breakdown computed in Step 6.

8. Based on the selected threshold breakdown (or stable flow) rate _λ_ or
(1 – _λ_ ), determine the resulting capacity value from the Weibull
distribution developed in Step 6 by using Equation 26-23. A value of
_λ_ of 15% is recommended.


**Equation 26-23:**


where _β_ and _γ_, respectively, are the shape and scale parameters of the fitted
Weibull distribution, and _λ_ is as defined previously. When λ = 0.15, the
equation simplifies to _c_ = _γ_ (0.163) [1/β] .

The following example is based on actual data and involves estimating
the capacity of a bottleneck on southbound I-440 in Raleigh, North Carolina.
In this example, sensor data in the vicinity of an on-ramp bottleneck were
collected for 260 weekdays from June 2014 to May 2015. The average
percentage of trucks observed in the traffic stream was less than 1%;
therefore, the conversion of trucks into PCEs is ignored for the purposes of
this example.

The theoretical number of 15-min observations is 260 days × 96
observations per day = 24,960 observations. After outliers were removed
(observations from incident and weather events and congested-flow
periods), there remained 22,984 periods when flow was deemed


uncongested and that represented similar operational and weather conditions.
Within these periods, 192 breakdowns were identified that met the criteria
described above.

Exhibit 26-13 summarizes the computations for this example, using the
eight steps given above. The example illustrates how the process yields a
capacity value based on the recommended 15% breakdown rate.

The exhibit shows 22,984 15-min flow rate observations in Column 4,
equivalent to 5,746 h of observations. Column 5 shows 192 breakdown
events. The probability of breakdown in a bin is computed in Column 6,
which is used to estimate capacity based on the defined λ threshold. Finally,
Column 7 shows the cumulative distribution of prebreakdown flow rates,
based on the data in Column 5.

The information in Exhibit 26-13 is shown graphically in Exhibit 26-14.
The solid black curve to the right shows the Weibull distribution fitted to the
data in Column 6; the actual data are also plotted. The distribution
parameters were _β_ = 9.13 and _γ_ = 2,569. Substituting these values into
Equation 26-23 and using _λ_ = 0.15 yields a capacity value of 2,105 pc/h/ln.
The gray dashed curve to the left in the exhibit represents the cumulative
distribution of prebreakdown flow rates (i.e., Column 7). In this case, the
calculated capacity value corresponded to approximately the 85th percentile
of the prebreakdown flow rate distribution, as represented by the dotted
lines.


**Exhibit 26-14: Capacity Estimation Using the 15% Acceptable Breakdown Rate Method**


In summary, the capacity estimation method considers the fact that flow
rates preceding breakdown can also occur at other times without being
followed by a breakdown. The definition of capacity is clear and
unambiguous and can be explained to the HCM user or practitioner without
much difficulty. However, the analyst needs to ensure there are a _sufficient_
_number of breakdown observations_ to be confident in the calculated
capacity value.


### **6. CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED VEHICLES**

**INTRODUCTION**

This section provides capacity adjustment factors (CAFs) for freeway
system elements to account for the presence of connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs) in the traffic stream. It also provides daily and hourly
maximum service volumes for basic freeway segments for different
proportions of CAVs in the traffic stream. Although CAVs are still a
developing technology, transportation agencies have an immediate need as
part of their long-range planning efforts to account for CAVs’ potential ability
to increase existing roadways’ throughput.

At the time of writing, CAVs capable of fully controlling the vehicle for
an entire trip without the possible need for human intervention, either under
specified operated conditions or under any operating condition [i.e., Society
of Automotive Engineers automation levels 4 and 5 ( _8_ )], were not yet in
production for consumer use. Although other HCM methodologies are based
on empirical observations of actual vehicles using actual roadway facilities,
calibrated simulation, or both, these approaches are currently infeasible
given the absence of level 4 and 5 CAVs in the traffic stream. Instead,
uncalibrated simulation modeling was conducted using CAV logic developed
for the Federal Highway Administration. Details about this modeling are
available in a paper ( _9_ ) available online in HCM Volume 4
(hcmvolume4.org) in the Technical Reference Library section for Chapter 26.


**CONCEPTS**


**CAV Technology**

CAVs integrate two separate types of technology, communications and
automation. The combination of these technologies is required to achieve
roadway capacity increases, as described below:


   - _Connected vehicles_ transmit data about their status to their
surroundings (e.g., roadside infrastructure, other road users). They
also receive information about their surroundings (e.g., traffic
conditions, weather conditions, presence of potential conflicting
vehicles, traffic signal timing) that motorists can use to adjust their
driving behavior in response to conditions present at a given time and
location. This exchange of information offers potential safety, fuel
economy, and environmental benefits. However, it is not clear how
connectivity affects car following and driver behavior and
subsequently freeway capacity.

   - _Automated vehicles_ take over all or a portion of the driving task.
Depending on the level of automation, a human may still need to take
over under certain conditions. In the absence of connectivity, the
information available to automated vehicles is limited to that which
can be gathered by on-board sensors, which is typically constrained
by a sensor’s line of sight and the rate at which the sensor takes
measurements (e.g., 10 times per second). As a result, for both safety
and passenger comfort reasons, current adaptive cruise control
systems offer minimum time gaps that are similar to, or longer than,
the gaps used by human drivers, and thus may decrease roadway
capacity when in widespread use ( _10_ ).

   - _Connected and automated vehicles_ communicate with each other and
with roadside infrastructure. The connectivity element provides
automated driving systems with more complete information about a
vehicle’s surroundings and enables cooperative vehicle maneuvers
that improve roadway operations. The vehicle’s enhanced detection
capabilities, as well as redundancy in detection, enable an automated
driving system to operate more efficiently and more safely than with
only an on-board system ( _11_ ). In particular, the cooperative adaptive
cruise control (CACC) feature enabled by vehicle-to-vehicle
communication allows CAVs to safely operate in platoons at shorter
headways than possible by either human-driven vehicles or
automated vehicles using adaptive cruise control only.


**Factors Influencing Freeway Capacity with CAVs in the Traffic**
**Stream**


_Basic Freeway Segments_

The HCM’s base capacity for basic freeway segments of 2,400 pc/h/ln
represents an average headway (i.e., back bumper to back bumper) of 1.5 s
between successive vehicles in a lane. Depending on vehicle length and
speed, it represents an intervehicle gap (i.e., back bumper to front bumper) of
around 1.1 s. To the extent that CAVs can ( _a_ ) safely reduce this average
intervehicle gap and ( _b_ ) reduce oscillations in the size of the gap between
successive vehicles, shorter headways and thus greater capacities are
feasible on basic freeway segments.

Basic freeway segment capacity is also affected by less-than-ideal
roadway geometric conditions (e.g., lane widths less than 12 ft, right-side
lateral clearance less than 6 ft), because human motorists drive more
cautiously under these conditions. However, lane-guidance technology is
expected to allow CAVs to travel along more-constrained freeway sections
without changing their speed or separation from another vehicle.

Drivers’ familiarity with a freeway can also affect capacity, with those
less familiar with a freeway’s geometry and typical traffic patterns likely to
drive more cautiously. CAVs, on the other hand, can be expected to have
current information about roadway geometry and conditions available to
them and therefore would be considered “familiar drivers” wherever they
operate.

The proportion of the traffic stream that is composed of CAVs will also
influence the achievable capacity increase. The greater the proportion of
CAVs in the traffic stream, the more frequently the benefits of connectivity
can be realized, because it becomes more likely that one or more CAVs will
trail another CAV and can form a short-headway platoon. In contrast, a CAV
following a human-driven vehicle or an automated vehicle without
connectivity will rely on adaptive cruise control and therefore travel at
headways similar to or longer than those used at present by human drivers.
Thus, under base conditions, a much greater increase in capacity is seen
when the proportion of CAVs on a freeway increases from 80% to 100% than
when it increases from 0% to 20% ( _9_ ). However, when a freeway has a
lower initial capacity (e.g., due to a lower design speed), capacity tends to
increase more linearly with increasing proportions of CAVs ( _9_ ).


_Freeway Merge, Diverge, and Weaving Segments_

The HCM’s capacity-estimation methods for freeway merge, diverge, and
weaving segments use the basic freeway segment capacity as a starting point;
therefore, all of the CAV-related factors that affect basic segment capacity
also affect the capacity of merge, diverge, and weaving segments. CACC is
used to insert a merging CAV into a platoon of CAVs, assuming the platoon’s
maximum length has not yet been reached, or as the new leader of a trailing
platoon otherwise.


_Freeway Managed Lane Segments_

No specific research on CAV effects on managed lane segments is
available. However, the results for a market penetration of 100% may be
used to approximate the capacity effects of a CAV-only managed lane.


_Oversaturated Conditions_

No specific research on CAV effects on oversaturated freeways is
available. As such, this section’s CAFs are primarily intended to be used for
planning-level estimates of freeway capacities, and not for detailed
operational analyses.


**Assumptions Affecting CAV Ability to Provide Higher Capacities**


_Intervehicle Gap_

Given that CAV technology and regulation is still in development,
assumptions necessarily have to be made when estimating CAVs’ potential
capacity benefit. A key assumption used in developing this section’s CAFs
was the minimum achievable intervehicle gap. Factors that could affect the
eventual intervehicle gap include:

   - _Legal or regulatory requirements_ dictating a minimum gap.

   - _Liability concerns_ on the part of vehicle manufacturers that cause
them to use a more conservative gap length than strictly needed for
safety.

   - _Passenger comfort concerns_ on the part of vehicle manufacturers to
minimize the amount and magnitude of acceleration and deceleration


needed to maintain intervehicle gaps and facilitate cooperative
merging and lane changing.

   - _Passenger lack of trust concerns_ on the part of vehicle owners
related to traveling at high speed close behind another vehicle.

   - _Need for sufficient gaps_ to accommodate lane-changing and merging.

   - _Mechanical differences_ between vehicles that affect their operational
characteristics, such as braking and acceleration.

The simulation modeling that developed this section’s CAFs
incorporated the following assumptions related to intervehicle gaps ( _9_ ):

   - _CAV capability._ The modeled CAVs had vehicle-to-vehicle
communication abilities and a working CACC system. CAVs acting
as platoon leaders reverted to adaptive cruise control (i.e., relying on
on-board sensors only).

   - _Human-driven vehicle capability._ The operation of human-driven
vehicles was calibrated for three scenarios: 2,400 pc/h/ln (matching
the HCM’s base capacity for basic freeway segments with a 70 mi/h
free-flow speed), 2,100 pc/h/ln, and 1,800 pc/h/ln. The latter two
scenarios represent freeway segments with some combination of
lower base free-flow speeds, narrow lanes, limited or no lateral
clearance, high ramp density, and unfamiliar drivers.

   - _Platooning behavior._ CAVs formed platoons. A CAV became the
leader of a platoon when the vehicle in front of it was either a nonCAV or a CAV that was the last vehicle in a platoon that had reached
its maximum length. Otherwise, a CAV that followed another CAV
joined the preceding CAV’s platoon. One-vehicle platoons were
possible, and relatively common when the proportion of CAVs in the
traffic stream was low. A CAV’s status could change from leader to
follower and back, depending on lane-changing and merging activity.

   - _Intraplatoon gaps._ A distribution of intervehicle gaps within
platoons was used, based on a field study of driver preferences for
gap size that used vehicles whose adaptive cruise control systems
were set to allow short gaps. The distribution consisted of 0.6 s for
57% of vehicles, 0.7 s for 24%, 0.9 s for 7%, and 1.1 s for 12%,


resulting in an average intervehicle gap within platoons of 0.71 s
( _12_ ).

   - _Interplatoon gaps._ A CAV that was the leader of a platoon operated
in adaptive cruise control mode, with a gap to the next vehicle of 2.0
s, based on adaptive cruise control settings in commercial use ( _13_ ).

   - _Maximum platoon size._ The maximum platoon size was 10 passenger
cars, constrained by the need to accommodate lane-changes and
merges at ramps and the need to maintain reliable communication
between the platoon leader and the vehicles toward the rear of the
platoon.


_System Reliability_

The ability of CAVs to safely operate with short intervehicle gaps
requires, among other things, low communications latency (i.e., information
can be quickly exchanged between vehicles and acted upon), vehicle
manufacturers to build vehicles with reliable components, vehicle owners to
promptly repair components if they do break, and regulatory agencies to
provide adequate bandwidth for vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
Consistent with other base-condition assumptions in the freeway
methodology (e.g., standard lane widths, good weather), a base assumption
for CAV analysis is that all necessary communication elements are in place
and working with a high degree of reliability.


_Traffic Stream Composition_

A key assumption an analyst will need to make when performing a CAV
analysis is the percentage of CAVs that will be in the traffic stream during the
analysis year(s). Once CAVs become available to consumers, it may take
many years for the vehicle fleet to transition to an all-CAV fleet. In 2018, the
average age of light cars and trucks in the United States was just under 12
years ( _14_ ), and it takes even longer for the national fleet to turn over.
Furthermore, based on past adoption rates of new automotive technologies
such as automatic transmissions, airbags, and hybrid vehicles, many people
may not choose a CAV the first or even the second time they replace their
vehicle ( _15_ ). On the other hand, if many urban dwellers decide not to replace
their car and rely instead on mobility services employing CAVs, adoption of


CAVs could occur more rapidly than with prior automotive technologies. The
possibility also exists that high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes could be
converted to CAV-only lanes (i.e., 100% CAVs) even though overall CAV
market penetration might be considerably less than 100%.

The simulation modeling that developed this section’s CAFs assumed a
traffic stream consisting of 100% passenger cars. The percentage of CAVs in
the traffic stream was varied from 0% to 100% in 20% increments. Analysts
should consider the latest available information about CAV adoption rates
and the effects of CAV usage on travel demand when performing an analysis
of CAV effects on freeway capacity.


**Addressing Uncertain Assumptions in a CAV Analysis**

Any evaluation of future conditions requires assumptions about future
population growth, mode choice, travel demand, and travel patterns, among
other factors, none of which are known with great certainty. Adding
assumptions related to CAVs, particularly when based on simulation that
cannot yet be calibrated to actual operating conditions, only increases the
uncertainty in the analysis inputs.

Because of this uncertainty, it is recommended that the CAV CAFs and
service volume tables presented in this section be applied to the evaluation
of “ _what if_ ” scenarios, rather than being taken as the final word on what _will_
happen once CAVs become widespread. In particular, the analyst should
consider:

   - _What if the minimum headway permitted by technology, regulation,_
_or policy, or the average headway produced by different vehicles’_
_user settings, is longer than the modeling assumed?_ In this case, the
capacity increase would be less than predicted by the CAV CAFs or
service volume tables.

   - _How reliable will the necessary communications and automation_
_technology be?_ To the extent that individual CAV-capable vehicles
must be driven by a human at any given time due to equipment
malfunction, the proportion of operating CAVs in the traffic stream
will be less than the proportion of CAV-capable vehicles.
(Alternatively, the demand will be lower, in the situation where only
vehicles with functioning systems are allowed on the facility.)


   - _How quickly will CAV technology become available and adopted,_
_and how will CAVs affect travel demand?_ The assumptions made
related to these questions will determine the assumed volume and
proportion of CAVs in the traffic stream, along with the assumed
CAF.


**CAPACITY ADJUSTMENT FACTORS**


_Basic Freeway Segments_

Exhibit 26-15 provides CAFs for basic freeway segments where CAVs
are present in the traffic stream, _CAFCAV_ . To determine the CAF value, first
calculate the segment’s initial adjusted capacity _cadj_ using Equation 12-8,
applying all other applicable CAFs. Next, determine the _CAFCAV_ value from
Exhibit 26-15 based on the proportion of CAVs in the traffic stream and the
initial adjusted capacity, interpolating as needed. Finally, determine the
segment’s adjusted capacity with CAVs by multiplying the initial adjusted
capacity by _CAFCAV_ .

Assumptions: Average intervehicle gap within CAV platoons = 0.71 s based on a
distribution (see text), CAV interplatoon gap = 2.0 s, maximum CAV platoon size = 10
pc, human-driven vehicles operate with average gaps calibrated to the given adjusted
segment capacity.


_Freeway Diverge Segments_


_CAFCAV_ values for freeway diverge segments are determined similarly to
basic freeway segments. First, calculate the segment’s initial adjusted
capacity _cmda_ using Equation 14-21, applying all other applicable CAFs.
Next, determine the _CAFCAV_ value from Exhibit 26-15 based on the
percentage of CAVs in the traffic stream and the initial adjusted capacity,
interpolating as needed. Finally, determine the segment’s adjusted capacity
with CAVs by multiplying the initial adjusted capacity by _CAFCAV_ .


_Freeway Merge Segments_

_CAFCAV_ values for freeway merge segments where CAVs are present in
the traffic stream are given in Exhibit 26-16, based on the proportion of
CAVs in the traffic stream and interpolating as needed. The segment’s
adjusted capacity is then determined using Equation 14-21 by applying all
applicable CAFs, including _CAFCAV_ .

distribution (see text), CAV interplatoon gap = 2.0 s, maximum CAV platoon size = 10
pc, human-driven vehicles operate with average gaps calibrated to 2,200 pc/h/ln.


_Freeway Weaving Segments_

_CAFCAV_ values for freeway weaving segments where CAVs are present in
the traffic stream are given in Exhibit 26-17. The CAF value is determined
from the proportion of CAVs in the traffic stream and the volume ratio (i.e.,
the weaving demand flow rate divided by the total demand flow rate in the
weaving segment), interpolating as needed. The weaving segment method in


Chapter 13 offers two definitions of capacity, one based on weaving flows
and one based on density. The CAFs in Exhibit 26-17 are intended to be
applied to the latter, density-based measure. The segment’s adjusted capacity
is then determined using Equation 13-9 by applying all applicable CAFs,
including _CAFCAV_ .


**Exhibit 26-17: Capacity Adjustment Factors for CAVs for Freeway Weaving Segments**

Interpolate for other CAV proportions and volume ratios.
The volume ratio is the weaving demand flow rate divided by the total demand flow
rate in the segment.
Assumptions: Average intervehicle gap within CAV platoons = 0.71 s based on a
distribution (see text), CAV interplatoon gap = 2.0 s, maximum CAV platoon size
= 10 pc, human-driven vehicles operate with average gaps calibrated to 2,200
pc/h/ln.


**SERVICE VOLUME TABLES**

Exhibit 26-18 presents daily maximum service volumes at LOS E for
basic freeway segments with CAVs present in the traffic stream. Values in the
exhibit represent 2-way average annual daily traffic (AADT) divided by the
total number of lanes in both directions. Exhibit 26-19 presents hourly
maximum volumes per lane at LOS E for basic freeway segments with CAVs
present in the traffic stream. Assumptions used in creating these exhibits are

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 1: FOUR-LANE FREEWAY LOS**


**The Facts**

   - Four-lane freeway (two lanes in each direction)

   - Lane width = 11 ft

   - Right-side lateral clearance = 2 ft

   - Commuter traffic (regular users)

   - Peak hour, peak direction demand volume = 2,000 veh/h

   - Traffic composition: 5% trucks


   - Peak hour factor (PHF) = 0.92

   - One cloverleaf interchange per mile

   - Level terrain

   - Facility operates under ideal conditions (no incidents, work zones, or
weather events).


**Comments**

The task is to find the expected LOS for this freeway during the worst 15
min of the peak hour. With one cloverleaf interchange per mile, the total ramp
density will be 4 ramps/mi.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are specified above.


**Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS**

The FFS of the freeway is estimated from Equation 12-2 as follows:


The adjustment for lane width is selected from Exhibit 12-20 for 11-ft
lanes (1.9 mi/h). The adjustment for right-side lateral clearance is selected
from Exhibit 12-21 for a 2-ft clearance on a freeway with two lanes in one
direction (2.4 mi/h). The total ramp density is 4 ramps/mi. Then


Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the SAF used in
Equation 12-5 is 1, and _FFSadj_ = _FFS._


**Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity**

The capacity of the freeway is estimated from Equation 12-6 as follows:


Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the CAF used in
Equation 12-8 is 1, and _cadj_ = _c._


**Step 4: Adjust Demand Volume**

The demand volume must be adjusted to a flow rate that reflects
passenger cars per hour per lane under equivalent base conditions by using
Equation 12-9.


The demand volume is given as 2,000 veh/h. The PHF is specified to be
0.92, and there are two lanes in each direction. The driver population
consists of regular users (commuters). Trucks make up 5% of the traffic
stream, so a heavy-vehicle adjustment factor must be determined.

From Exhibit 12-25, the PCE for trucks is 2.0 for level terrain. The
heavy-vehicle adjustment factor is then computed with Equation 12-10.


then


Because this value is less than the base capacity of 2,308 pc/h/ln for a
freeway with FFS = 60.8 mi/h, LOS F does not exist, and the analysis
continues to Step 5.


**Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density**

The FFS of the basic freeway segment is now estimated along with the
demand flow rate (in passenger cars per hour per lane) under equivalent base
conditions. Using the equations provided in Exhibit 12-6, the breakpoint for a
60.8-mi/h FFS speed–flow curve is


As the flow rate of 1,142 pc/h/ln is less than the breakpoint value of
1,568 pc/h/ln, the freeway operates within the constant-speed portion of the
speed–flow curve, so _S_ = 60.8 mi/h. The density of the traffic stream may
now be computed from Equation 12-11.


**Step 6: Determine LOS**

From Exhibit 12-15, a density of 18.8 pc/mi/ln corresponds to LOS C,
but it is close to the boundary for LOS B, which is a maximum of 18
pc/mi/ln. This solution could also be calculated graphically from Exhibit 1216, as illustrated in Exhibit 26-21.


**Exhibit 26-21: Example Problem 1: Graphical Solution**


**Discussion**

This basic freeway segment of a four-lane freeway is expected to operate
at LOS C during the worst 15 min of the peak hour. It is important to note that
the operation, although at LOS C, is close to the LOS B boundary. In most
jurisdictions, this operation would be considered to be quite acceptable.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2: NUMBER OF LANES REQUIRED FOR**
**TARGET LOS**


**The Facts**

   - Demand volume = 4,000 veh/h (one direction)

   - Level terrain

   - Traffic composition: 8% SUTs and buses

   - Provision of 12-ft lanes


   - Provision of 6-ft right-side lateral clearance

   - Commuter traffic (regular users)

   - PHF = 0.85

   - Ramp density = 3 ramps/mi

   - Target LOS = D

   - Facility operates under ideal conditions (no incidents, work zones, or
weather events).


**Comments**

This example problem is a classic design application of the methodology.
The number of lanes needed to provide LOS D during the worst 15 min of the
peak hour is to be determined.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are specified above.


**Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS**

FFS is estimated by using Equation 12-2. Because the lane width and
lateral clearance to be provided on the new freeway will be 12 ft and 6 ft,
respectively, there are no adjustments for these features from Exhibit 12-20
or Exhibit 12-21. The total ramp density is given as 3 ramps/mi. Then


Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the SAF used in
Equation 12-5 is 1, and _FFSadj_ = _FFS._


**Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity**


The capacity of the freeway is estimated from Equation 12-6.


Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the CAF used in
Equation 12-8 is 1, and _cadj_ = _c._


**Step 4: Estimate Number of Lanes Needed**

Because this is a design analysis, Step 4 of the operational analysis
methodology is modified. Equation 12-23 may be used directly to determine
the number of lanes needed to provide at least LOS D.


A value of the maximum service flow rate must be selected from Exhibit
12-37 for an FFS of 65 mi/h and LOS D. Note that this exhibit only provides
these values in 5-mi/h increments; therefore, FFS is rounded to 65 mi/h. The
corresponding maximum service flow rate is 2,060 pc/h/ln.

The PHF is given as 0.85. A heavy-vehicle factor for 8% trucks must be
determined by using Exhibit 12-25 for level terrain. The PCE of trucks on
level terrain is 2.0, so the heavy-vehicle adjustment based on Equation 12-10
is


and


It is not possible to build 2.5 lanes. To provide a minimum of LOS D, it
will be necessary to provide three lanes in each direction, or a six-lane
freeway.

At this point, the design application ends. It is possible, however, to
consider what speed, density, and LOS will prevail when three lanes are
actually provided. Therefore, the example problem continues with Steps 5
and 6.


**Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density**

In pursuing additional information, the problem now reverts to an
operational analysis of a three-lane basic freeway segment with a demand
volume of 4,000 pc/h.

Equation 12-9 is used to compute the actual demand flow rate per lane
under equivalent base conditions.


From Exhibit 12-6, the breakpoint for a speed–flow curve with FFS
equal to 67.3 is


In this case, the demand flow rate of 1,694 pc/h/ln exceeds the breakpoint
value of 1,308 pc/h/ln, and the average speed will be less than the FFS.

The expected speed of the traffic stream may be estimated by using either
Exhibit 12-7 (for a graphical solution) or Equation 12-1 as follows:


The density may now be computed from Equation 12-11.


**Step 6: Determine LOS**

Entering Exhibit 12-15 with a density of 25.9 pc/mi/ln, the LOS is C, but
that density is very close to the boundary of LOS D, which is 26 pc/mi/ln.


**Discussion**

The resulting LOS is C, which represents a better performance than the
target design. Although the minimum number of lanes needed was 2.5, which
would have produced a minimal LOS D, providing three lanes yields a
density that is close to the LOS C boundary. In any event, the target LOS of
the design will be met by providing a six-lane basic freeway segment.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3: SIX-LANE FREEWAY LOS AND**
**CAPACITY**


**The Facts**

   - Volume of 5,000 veh/h (one direction, existing)

   - Volume of 5,788 veh/h (one direction, in 3 years)

   - Traffic composition: 4% trucks

   - Rolling terrain


   - Three lanes in each direction

   - FFS = 70 mi/h (measured)

   - PHF = 0.96

   - Commuter traffic (regular users)

   - Traffic growth = 5% per year

   - Facility operates under ideal conditions (no incidents, work zones, or
weather events).


**Comments**

This example consists of two operational analyses, one for the present
demand volume of 5,000 pc/h and one for the demand volume of 5,788 pc/h
expected in 3 years. In addition, a planning element is introduced: Assuming
traffic grows as expected, when will the capacity of the roadway be
exceeded? This analysis requires that capacity be determined in addition to
the normal output of operational analyses.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are specified above.


**Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS**

Step 2 is not needed, as the FFS was directly measured (70 mi/h).
Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the SAF used in
Equation 12-5 is 1, and _FFSadj_ = _FFS._


**Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity**

The capacity of the freeway is estimated from Equation 12-6.


Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the CAF used in
Equation 12-8 is 1, and _cadj_ = _c._


**Step 4: Adjust Demand Volume**

In this case, two demand volumes will be adjusted by using Equation 129.


The PHF is given as 0.96, and there are three lanes in each direction. The
heavy-vehicle factor will reflect 4% trucks in rolling terrain. From Exhibit
12-25, the PCE for trucks in rolling terrain is 3.0. Equation 12-10 then gives


Two values of _vp_ are computed: one for present conditions and one for
conditions in 3 years.


**Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density**

Two values of speed and density will be estimated, one each for the
present and future conditions. Equation 12-1 will be used to estimate speeds.


First, the breakpoint for the speed–flow curve is computed from Exhibit 126.


One equation applies to both cases; a 70-mi/h FFS with a flow rate over
1,200 pc/h/ln is used.


The corresponding densities may now be estimated from Equation 12-11.


**Step 6: Determine LOS**


From Exhibit 12-15, the LOS for the present situation is D, and the LOS
for the future scenario (in 3 years) is E due to the increase in density.


**Step 7: Determine When Capacity Will Be Reached**

Step 7 is an additional step for this problem. To determine when capacity
will be reached, the capacity of the basic freeway segment must be
estimated. From Exhibit 12-37, the maximum service flow rate for LOS E on
a basic freeway segment with a 70-mi/h FFS is 2,400 pc/h/ln. This flow rate
is synonymous with capacity.

The analyst must be sure the capacity and demand flow rates compared in
Step 7 are measured on the same basis. The 2,400 pc/h/ln is a flow rate
under equivalent base conditions. The demand flow rate in 3 years was
estimated to be 2,171 pc/h/ln on this basis. These two values, therefore, may
be compared. As an alternative, the capacity could be computed for
prevailing conditions with Equation 12-24.


This capacity, however, is stated as a _flow rate_ . The demand volume is
stated as an hourly volume. Thus, a _service volume_ for LOS E is needed as
estimated from Equation 12-25.


The problem may be solved either by comparing the demand volume of
5,788 veh/h (in 3 years) with the hourly capacity of 6,400 veh/h or by
comparing the demand flow rate under equivalent base conditions of 2,171
pc/h/ln with the base capacity of 2,400 pc/h/ln. With the hourly demand
volume and capacity,


On the basis of the forecasts of traffic growth, the basic freeway segment
described will reach capacity within 5 years. The demand value of 5,788
veh/h occurs 3 years from the present per the problem description, and the
calculation above shows capacity is reached after an additional 2 years. If
this result is added to the 3-year planning horizon, capacity will be reached
within 5 years of the time of the analysis.


**Discussion**

The LOS on this segment will reach LOS E within 3 years due to the
increase in density. The demand is expected to exceed capacity within 5
years. Given the normal lead times for planning, design, and approvals
before the start of construction, it is probable that planning and preliminary
design for an improvement should be started immediately.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 4: LOS ON A FIVE-LANE HIGHWAY WITH A**
**TWO WAY LEFT-TURN LANE**


**The Facts**

   - Lane width: 12 ft

   - Lateral clearance, both sides of the roadway: 12 ft

   - Traffic composition: 6% trucks, with default truck mix (30% SUTs,
70% TTs)

   - Access points per mile: eastbound = 10; westbound = 0

   - PHF = 0.90

   - Commuter traffic (regular users)

   - Median type: two-way left-turn lane

   - Peak hour demand: 1,500 veh/h

   - The upgrade occurs in the westbound direction

   - Posted speed limit = 45 mi/h


**Comments**

A 6,600-ft segment of a five-lane highway (two travel lanes in each
direction plus a two-way left-turn lane) is on a 3.5% grade. At what LOS is
the facility expected to operate in each direction?

There is one segment in each direction. The upgrade and downgrade
segments on the 3.5% grade must be analyzed separately. This example is
more complex than the previous examples because the segment
characteristics are not all the same, particularly the number of access points.
Because no base FFS is given, it will be estimated as the speed limit plus 7
mi/h, or 45 + 7 = 52 mi/h.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are given above.


**Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS**

FFS is estimated by using Equation 12-3.


In this case, the base FFS is estimated to be 52 mi/h. The lane width is 12
ft, which is the base condition; therefore, _fLW_ = 0.0 mi/h (Exhibit 12-20). The
lateral clearance is 12 ft at each roadside, but a maximum value of 6 ft may
be used. A two-way left-turn lane is considered to have a median lateral
clearance of 6 ft. Thus, the total lateral clearance is 6 + 6 = 12 ft, which is
also a base condition. Therefore, _fTLC_ = 0.0 mi/h (Exhibit 12-22). The
median-type adjustment _fM_ is also 0.0 mi/h (Exhibit 12-23).

For this example problem, only the access-point density produces a
nonzero adjustment to the base FFS. The eastbound (EB) segment (3.5%
downgrade) has 10 access points/mi. From Exhibit 12-24, the corresponding
FFS adjustment is 2.5 mi/h. The westbound (WB) segment (3.5% upgrade)
has 0 access points/mi and a corresponding FFS adjustment of 0.0 mi/h.
Therefore,


**Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity**

The capacity of the multilane highway segment is estimated as follows
from Equation 12-7.


**Step 4: Adjust Demand Volume**

Demand volume is adjusted by using Equation 12-9.


To compute the heavy-vehicle adjustment factor _fHV_, PCEs for trucks are
needed for ( _a_ ) the 3.5%, 6,600-ft upgrade and ( _b_ ) the 3.5%, 6,600-ft
downgrade. The segment is 1.25 mi (6,600/5,280 ft) long. The following
values are obtained from Exhibit 12-26:

   - Eastbound: 2.24 (using 6% trucks, a 2% downgrade, and 1.25-mi
grade length). Note that all downgrades exceeding 2% use the PCE
values for a 2% downgrade.

   - Westbound: 3.97 (using 6% trucks, a 3.5% upgrade, and a 1.25-mi
grade length).

The heavy-vehicle adjustment factors _fHV_ for each segment are calculated
from Equation 12-10.


The segments’ flow rates are then calculated as


**Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density**

Speed is estimated with Equation 12-1 or the graph in Exhibit 12-7. With
Equation 12-1, both demand flow rates are less than the multilane highway
breakpoint value of 1,400 pc/h/ln. Therefore, the speeds _S_ are equal to FFS.
The densities are computed from Equation 12-11.


**Step 6: Determine LOS**

LOS is found by comparing the densities of the segments with the criteria
in Exhibit 12-15. As both densities are greater than 18 pc/mi/ln, both upgrade
and downgrade segments operate at LOS C.


**Discussion**

Even though the upgrade and downgrade segments operate at LOS C, they
are very close to the LOS B boundary (18.0 pc/mi/ln). Both directions of the
multilane highway on this grade operate well.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5: MIXED-FLOW FREEWAY OPERATIONS**

This example illustrates the application of the mixed-flow model for an
extended single grade on a six-lane rural freeway.


**The Facts**

   - 2-mi basic segment on a 5% upgrade

   - Traffic composition: 5% SUTs and 10% TTs

   - FFS = 65 mi/h

   - Mixed-traffic flow rate = 1,500 veh/h/ln


**Comments**

The task is to estimate the segment’s speed and density. Given the
significant truck presence (15%) and the 5%, 2-mi grade, the mixed-flow
model should be applied.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are specified above.


**Step 2: Compute Mixed-Flow Capacity Adjustment Factor**

Capacity is computed with Equation 26-1.


There are three terms in the equation. The CAF for auto-only _CAFao_ is
1.00, as no driver population, weather, incident, or work zone adjustments
are specified in the problem statement.


The truck effect term is computed with Equation 26-2.


The grade effect term is computed with Equation 26-3 and Equation 26-4.


then


The mixed-flow capacity is then computed from Equation 26-5.


The auto-only capacity _Cao_ is computed from Exhibit 12-6.


then


As the mixed-traffic flow rate of 1,500 veh/h/ln is less than the mixedflow capacity of 1,725 veh/h/ln, the analysis can proceed.


**Step 3: Compute Mixed-Flow FFS and FFS Adjustment Factor**


Equation 26-6 through Equation 26-8 compute the free-flow travel rates
for SUTs, TTs, and automobiles, respectively. The FFS of this basic freeway
segment is 65 mi/h. Truck performance curves for free-flow speeds other
than 70 ± 2.5 mi/h are provided in Appendix A. The 65-mi/h curves for
SUTs and TTs are found in Exhibit 26-A4 and Exhibit 26-A9, respectively.

The travel time for a SUT _TSUT_ at a point 10,000 ft along the upgrade can
be read directly from Exhibit 26-A4 by observing where the 5% upgrade
curve intersects 10,000 ft: 134 s. Similarly, the travel time for a TT _TTT_ is
173 s.

As the grade is 2 mi (10,560 ft) long and the performance curves only
provide values up to 10,000 ft, Equation 26-12 is used to determine the
travel time rates for the upgrade as a whole. The slope of the travel time
versus distance curve _δ_, which is used in Equation 26-12, can be determined
from Exhibit 26-7 for SUTs and Exhibit 26-8 for TTs. The _δ_ values are
0.0146 and 0.0202, respectively.

Then


As this step’s objective is to compute the FFS of the mixed-traffic stream,
the traffic interaction term _ΔτTI_ is zero, and the mixed-flow rate is set to 1
veh/h/ln. The SUT, TT, and auto travel time rates are then computed using
Equation 26-6 through Equation 26-8.


Mixed-flow travel rates and speeds are computed with Equation 26-13
and Equation 26-14.


Finally, the segment’s SAF is estimated with Equation 26-15.


**Step 4: Compute the Mixed-Flow Rate at the Breakpoint**

The breakpoint is calculated from Equation 26-16.


where the auto-only breakpoint is calculated by using an equation given in
Exhibit 12-6.


then


This result implies that speeds drop immediately at zero flow (i.e., the
mixed-flow FFS cannot be sustained even at low flows).

**Step 5: Compute Modal and Mixed-Flow Speeds at Capacity and**
**90% of Capacity**

The speeds and densities for each mode at capacity and 90% of capacity
are calculated in this step. Equation 26-6 through Equation 26-8 are applied
twice more, once for a flow rate equal to the mixed-flow capacity of 1,725
veh/h/ln calculated in Step 2, and again for a flow rate equal to 90% of
capacity. Applying these equations requires determining the traffic
interaction term _ΔτTI_, which in turn requires determining the equivalent autoonly speed _Sao_ .



The calculation process will be demonstrated for conditions at capacity.
The value of _C_ mix determined in Step 2 (1,725 veh/h/ln) will be used as _v_ mix
in the calculations.



The auto-only speed at capacity is computed by Equation 26-10.



⎧



⎨



The value of _v_ mix _/CAF_ mix is 1,725/0.734 = 2,350 veh/h/ln, which is
greater than the auto-only breakpoint of 1,400 veh/h/ln calculated in Step 4.
Therefore, the second of the two equations is applied.



The traffic interaction term can now be computed with Equation 26-9.


Equation 26-6 through Equation 26-8 are now applied to find the modal
travel time rates at capacity.


Based on these travel rates, the overall mixed-traffic space mean speed
at capacity can be calculated with Equation 26-19.


The same process is used to calculate the mixed-traffic speed at 90% of
capacity ( _v_ mix = 0.9 × 1,725 = 1,553 veh/h/ln). The resulting calculation
results are


**Step 6: Compute the Exponent for the Speed–Flow Curve**

The exponent for the speed–flow curve is computed from Equation 2620.


**Step 7: Compute the Mixed-Flow Speed Under Mixed-Flow**
**Conditions**

The mixed-flow speed under mixed-flow conditions is computed by
Equation 26-21.


⎧


⎨

⎧



⎨



The mixed-flow rate is 1,500 veh/h/ln, which is greater than the

**Step 8: Compute the Mixed-Flow Density Under Mixed-Flow**
**Conditions**



The final step is to compute the mixed-flow density by using Equation
26-22.



**Comparison with the PCE-Based Approach**



For comparison purposes, the following procedure show the results for
this case if the PCE-based approach explained in Chapter 12 is applied.



_Step 1: Input Data_



All input data are specified above.



_Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS_



For basic freeway segments, Equation 12-2 can be used to estimate FFS.


For the purposes of comparing the two methods with respect to truck
effects on FFS, the lane width, lateral clearance, and ramp density adjustment
factors can be neglected. Then,


The adjusted FFS is computed from Equation 12-5, assuming no weather
or incident effects.


_Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity_

Equation 12-6 is used to compute the capacity of a basic freeway
segment.


Assuming no adverse weather conditions or incidents, the adjusted
capacity from Equation 12-8 is then


_Step 4: Adjust Demand Volume_

This basic freeway segment is in a rural area with more TTs than SUTs.
Therefore, the PCE table for 30% SUTs and 70% TTs (Exhibit 12-26) will
be used. As stated in the Facts section of the example problem, the grade is
5% for 2 mi. There are no values specifically for a 5% grade in Exhibit 1226; therefore, PCE values will be interpolated from the values for 4.5% and
5.5%. As the maximum grade length provided in the exhibit is 1 mi for these


two grades, values for a 1-mi grade will also apply to longer grades. For a
1-mi, 4.5% grade, the PCE value for 15% trucks is 3.11; and the PCE value
for a 1-mi, 5.5% grade with 15% trucks is 3.51. Interpolating between these
two values for a 5% grade results in a PCE of 3.31.

The heavy-vehicle factor can be computed with Equation 12-10.


Equation 12-9 is used to adjust the demand volume to account for truck
presence. The freeway is a three-lane facility and the driver population is
assumed to be all local drivers.


_Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density_

The speed can be read directly from Exhibit 12-7 for a demand flow rate
of 2,019 pc/h/ln. Under base conditions, the mean speed of the traffic stream
is 59.6 mi/h as calculated from Equation 26-1.

Equation 12-11 is used to compute density.


If the density above is multiplied by the heavy-vehicle factor, then the
mixed-flow density _D_ mix can be estimated as follows:


The PCE-based density of 25.2 veh/mi/ln is about 22% lower than 32.6
veh/mi/ln, which is the density predicted in Step 8 of the mixed-flow model.
_D_ mix is the mixed-flow density, not an auto-only flow density. As such, it
cannot be used to derive LOS.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 6: SEVERE WEATHER EFFECTS ON A**
**BASIC FREEWAY SEGMENT**


**The Facts**

   - Four-lane freeway (two lanes in each direction)

   - Lane width = 11 ft

   - Right-side lateral clearance = 2 ft

   - Commuter traffic (regular users)

   - Peak hour, peak direction demand volume = 2,000 veh/h

   - Traffic composition: 5% trucks

   - PHF = 0.92

   - One cloverleaf interchange per mile

   - Rolling terrain

   - Facility operates under heavy snow conditions ( _CAF_ = 0.78; _SAF_ =
0.86).


**Comments**

The task is to find the expected LOS for this freeway during the worst 15
min of the peak hour under heavy snow conditions. With one cloverleaf
interchange per mile, the total ramp density will be 4 ramps/mi. This
example problem is similar to Example Problem 1, with the only change
being the presence of heavy snow.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are specified above.


**Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS**

The FFS of the freeway is estimated from Equation 12-2 as follows:


The adjustment for lane width is selected from Exhibit 12-20 for 11-ft
lanes (1.9 mi/h). The adjustment for right-side lateral clearance is selected
from Exhibit 12-21 for a 2-ft clearance on a freeway with two lanes in one
direction (2.4 mi/h). The total ramp density is 4 ramps/mi. Then


A free-flow speed adjustment factor (SAF) for heavy snow conditions
can be obtained from Exhibit 11-5 in Chapter 11, Freeway Reliability
Analysis, by interpolating between the values for 60 and 65 mi/h (0.86 and
0.85, respectively), resulting in a SAF of 0.86. No other speed adjustments
are made, as no incidents were specified in the problem statement and
because the driver population was specified to be commuters. The SAF is
applied through Equation 12-5.


**Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity**

Exhibit 11-5 also provides a CAF of 0.78 for heavy snow conditions,
applicable to all FFS values. As with the SAF in Step 2, no other capacity
adjustments apply in this situation. The freeway’s capacity is then estimated
using Equation 12-6.


**Step 4: Adjust Demand Volume**

The demand volume is adjusted by using Equation 12-9 to a flow rate that
reflects passenger cars per hour per lane under equivalent base conditions.


The demand volume is given as 2,000 veh/h. The PHF is specified to be
0.92, and there are two lanes in each direction. Trucks make up 5% of the
traffic stream, so a heavy-vehicle adjustment factor must be determined.

From Exhibit 12-25, the PCE for trucks is 3.0 for rolling terrain. The
heavy-vehicle adjustment factor is then computed by using Equation 12-10.


then


Because this value is less than the base capacity of 1,743 pc/h/ln for a
freeway with an FFS of 52.3 mi/h, LOS F conditions do not exist, and the
analysis continues to Step 5.


**Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density**

The FFS of the basic freeway segment is now estimated along with the
demand flow rate (in passenger cars per hour per lane) under equivalent base
conditions. Using the equations provided in Exhibit 12-6, the breakpoint for a
53.5-mi/h FFS speed–flow curve is


Because the flow rate is greater than the breakpoint value, the operating
speed of the segment is estimated from Equation 12-1, by using a value of 2
for the exponent calibration parameter _a_ from Exhibit 12-6.


The density may now be computed from Equation 12-11.


**Step 6: Determine LOS**

From Exhibit 12-15, a density of 22.8 pc/mi/ln corresponds to LOS C.


**Discussion**

This basic freeway segment of a four-lane freeway is expected to operate
at LOS C during the worst 15 min of the peak hour under heavy snow
conditions, with an average speed of 52.3 mi/h and a density of 22.8
pc/mi/ln. By contrast, the same facility under no adverse weather conditions
would be expected to operate at an FFS of 60.8 mi/h and a density of 19.7
pc/mi/ln, but still at LOS C. Although the segment’s performance is affected
by the snow, the overall LOS is unchanged.

However, the segment’s capacity is reduced from 2,308 to 1,734 pc/h/ln,
which means the snow effect would be more severe at elevated volume-tocapacity ratios, particularly as the segment approached capacity. For
elevated flow rates, the snow condition is expected to result in further
deterioration of speed and breakdown at lower flow rates.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 7: BASIC MANAGED LANE SEGMENT**


**The Facts**


   - Six-lane freeway with two general purpose lanes and one managed
lane in each direction

   - Lane width = 11 ft

   - Right-side lateral clearance = 2 ft

   - Commuter traffic (regular users)

   - Peak hour, peak direction demand volume in the general purpose
lanes = 2,000 veh/h (Case 1) or 3,800 veh/h (Case 2)

   - Peak hour, peak direction demand volume in the managed lane (both
cases) = 1,300 veh/h

   - Continuous access separation between the managed and general
purpose lanes

   - FFS = 60 mi/h for both the managed and general purpose lanes

   - Traffic composition: 7.5% trucks, using the default truck mix for both
the managed and general purpose lanes

   - PHF = 0.92

   - One cloverleaf interchange per mile

   - Level terrain

   - Facility operates under ideal conditions (no incidents, work zones, or
weather events).


**Comments**

The task is to find the expected LOS for this freeway for both the
managed and general purpose lanes during the worst 15 min of the peak hour
for the two described cases. With one cloverleaf interchange per mile, the
total ramp density will be 4 ramps/mi.


**Step 1: Input Data**

All input data are specified above.


**Step 2: Estimate and Adjust FFS**


The facility’s FFS is given as 60 mi/h for both the managed and general
purpose lanes. Because the facility is operating under ideal conditions, the
SAF used in Equation 12-5 is 1.


**Step 3: Estimate and Adjust Capacity**

The capacity of the freeway general purpose lanes is estimated from
Equation 12-6 as follows:


As the freeway is operating under ideal conditions, no capacity
adjustment is made for the general purpose lanes (i.e., CAF = 1 in Equation
12-8).

The capacity of the managed lane is calculated with Equation 12-14.


As with the general purpose lanes, CAF = 1 for the managed lane. The
values of the parameters _C_ 75 and _λc_ are obtained from Exhibit 12-30, and are
1,800 and 10, respectively, for continuous access separation. Then


**Step 4: Adjust Demand Volume**

The demand volume is adjusted by using Equation 12-9 to a flow rate that
reflects passenger cars per hour per lane under equivalent base conditions.


The demand volume is given as 2,000 veh/h and 3,800 veh/h for Cases 1
and 2, respectively. The PHF is specified to be 0.92, and there are two lanes
in each direction. Trucks make up 5% of the traffic stream, so a heavyvehicle adjustment factor must be determined.

From Exhibit 12-25, the PCE for trucks is 2.0 for level terrain. The
heavy-vehicle adjustment factor is then computed using Equation 12-10.


Then for Case 1,


and for Case 2,


The flow rate on the managed lane is


Because all the flow rates are less than their corresponding capacities,
LOS F conditions do not exist, and the analysis continues to Step 5.


**Step 5: Estimate Speed and Density**

The FFS of the basic freeway segment is now estimated, along with the
demand flow rate (in passenger cars per hour per lane) under equivalent base
conditions. Based on the equations provided in Exhibit 12-6, the breakpoint
for a 60-mi/h FFS speed–flow curve is


In Case 1, the flow rate is less than the breakpoint value of 1,600 pc/h/ln.
As this flow rate is in the constant-speed portion of the curve, _SGP,_ Case1 = 60
mi/h. The density of the traffic stream is computed from Equation 12-11.


In Case 2, the flow rate is higher than the breakpoint. Therefore, the
speed is computed with Equation 12-1, by using a value of 2 for the exponent
calibration parameter _a_ from Exhibit 12-6, as follows:


Density is computed with Equation 12-11.


To compute the managed lane speed, the breakpoint first needs to be
computed by using Equation 12-13 and values for the parameters _BP_ 75 and
_λBP_ from Exhibit 12-30.


Because the managed lane flow rate is higher than the breakpoint, three
speeds, _S_ 1, _S_ 2, and _S_ 3, need to be computed by using Equations 12-15, 12-17,
and 12-19, respectively (with parameters from Exhibit 12-30), as follows:


The space mean speed of the managed lane is given by Equation 12-12.


Because the managed lane’s demand flow of 1,519 pc/h/ln is greater than
the breakpoint value of 500 pc/h/ln calculated in Step 4, the second of the
two equations applies. To apply this equation, the value of the indicator
variable _Ic_ must first be determined from Equation 12-18.


⎧

⎨
# **⎪**



⎧

⎨



In Case 1, the density of the adjacent general purpose lane is less than 35
pc/mi/ln, as determined in Step 5. As a result, the indicator variable _Ic_ will
have a value of zero. Thus, the managed lane speed in Case 1 will be



In Case 2, the density of the adjacent general purpose lane is greater than
35 pc/ln/mi, and therefore the indicator variable _Ic_ will have a value of 1.
The managed lane speed in Case 2 will be



The managed lane density for the two cases is given by Equation 12-11.



**Step 6: Determine LOS**



The managed lane facility’s density of 27.0 pc/mi/ln under Case 1
corresponds to LOS D, but it is close to the LOS C boundary, which has a
maximum value of 26 pc/mi/ln. In Case 2, the density of 36.3 pc/mi/ln
corresponds to LOS E.



**Discussion**



In this example, the managed lane’s operating speed and density have
been investigated for two operating conditions in the general purpose lanes.


When high-density conditions exist in the general purpose lanes, the managed
lane’s operational speed is reduced and, as a consequence, the managed lane
operates at a worse LOS than when lower-density conditions exist in the
general purpose lanes.

outlined in Exhibit 15-9.


**The Facts**

The segment has the following known characteristics:

   - Segment length = 3,960 ft (0.75 mi);

   - Segment type = Passing Constrained;

   - No upstream passing lanes;


   - Vehicle count in the analysis direction = 752 veh/h;

   - Posted speed limit: 50 mi/h;

   - Percent heavy vehicles (%HV) = 5%;

   - Percent grade = 0%;

   - Horizontal curvature = none;

   - Lane width = 12 ft;

   - Shoulder width = 6 ft; and

   - Access points = 0.


**Objective**

Estimate the LOS in the subject direction on the two-lane highway
segment as described.


**Step 1: Identify Facility Study Boundaries and Segmentation**

The limits of the segment were identified following the guidance given in
Step 1 on page 15-15. The characteristics of this segment were determined
by examination to be essentially homogenous. These characteristics included
the ability to pass, lane geometry, grades, lane and shoulder widths, posted
speed limit, traffic demands, adjacent land uses, and driveways.

A field examination of the segment determined that it met the definition of
a Passing Constrained segment, being a segment in which “passing in the
oncoming lane is either prohibited or is effectively negligible due to
geometric or sight distance limitations.”


**Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and** _**d/c**_ **Ratio**

In this step, the hourly demand volume at the upstream entrance of the
directional segment being evaluated is converted to a peak 15-min flow rate
by applying the peak hour factor (PHF) using Equation 15-1:


The capacity of a Passing Constrained segment is 1,700 veh/h, as stated
in the description of Step 2 on page 15-18. The demand flow rate is less than
capacity; therefore the calculation process proceeds to Step 3. Note that it is
only necessary to compute the actual opposing flow rate for Passing Zone
segments.


**Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification**

The segment is assigned a vertical alignment classification of 1, based on
Exhibit 15-11 for a level (0% grade), 0.75-mi-long segment. From Exhibit
15-10, the segment length of 0.75 mi is between the minimum (0.25 mi) and
maximum (3.0 mi) lengths for a Passing Constrained segment of vertical
class 1, and therefore no adjustment is needed to the segment length.


**Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed**

As stated on page 15-18, direct field measurement of FFS is preferred. In
this case it is not feasible to measure the FFS, so it will be estimated using
the procedure given in Step 4.

Because this is a Passing Constrained segment, the opposing flow rate _vo_
is set at 1,500 veh/h in Equation 15-4 for the purposes of computing FFS,
regardless of the actual opposing flow rate. First, the base free-flow speed
_BFFS_ is estimated using Equation 15-2. Next, Equation 15-4 through
Equation 15-6 are used to determine factors relating to lane and shoulder
width, access-point density, and heavy-vehicle percentage, which are used in
the estimation of FFS. Finally, the FFS is estimated by Equation 15-3.


There are no geometry-related FFS adjustments for 12-ft lanes and 6-ft
shoulders. There are also no adjustments for access points (driveways or
streets), because this segment has no access points.


**Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed**

Because the demand flow rate in the subject direction is greater than 100
veh/h, the equations given in Step 5 are used to estimate the average speed.


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ determines how rapidly the average speed is
estimated to decrease as a function of the entering flow rate. It is computed
as a function of six coefficients _b_ 0 to _b_ 5, which are obtained from Exhibit 1513 for a Passing Constrained segment. For a segment of vertical class 1,
these coefficients are 0.0558, 0.0542, 0.3278, 0.1029, 0, and 0, respectively.
Equation 15-8 is then used to determine the slope coefficient.


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

The power coefficient _p_ is used to estimate how fast the average speed
decreases at higher flow rates. The equation uses nine coefficients _f_ 0 to _f_ 8,
which are obtained from Exhibit 15-19 for a Passing Constrained segment.
For a segment of vertical class 1, all of these coefficients take on values of 0,
except for _f_ 0 (0.67576), _f_ 3 (0.12060), and _f_ 4 (−0.35919). Equation 15-11 is
then used to determine the power coefficient.


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_

The average speed for the given entry flow rate is computed in Step 5-3
using Equation 15-7. The previously computed flow rate _vd_, slope coefficient
_m_, and power coefficient _p_ are used in this equation.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

Because this is a straight segment, no adjustment to the speed estimate is
required for horizontal alignment.


_Assessment of Speed Results_

The average speed at a directional flow rate of 800 veh/h is estimated to
be approximately 3 mi/h (about 5%) lower than the FFS, but about 4 mi/h
(about 7%) higher than the posted speed limit.


**Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers**

The service measure _percent followers_ is estimated in Step 6 for the
given flow rate _vd_ . under the prevailing geometric conditions and percent
heavy vehicles. First, the percent followers at 100% of capacity is estimated.
Next, the percent followers at 25% of capacity is estimated. Then, the slope
and power coefficients for an exponential curve fitting those two points
(percent followers at 25% and 100% capacity) are estimated. Finally, the
fitted curve is used to estimate the percent followers for the given flow rate.


_Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity_

Percent followers at capacity is calculated using Equation 15-18,
applying eight parameters _b_ 0 to _b_ 7 obtained from Exhibit 15-24.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity is calculated using Equation
15-20, applying eight parameters _c_ 0 to _c_ 7 obtained from Exhibit 15-26.


_Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient _m_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs two parameters _d_ 1 and _d_ 2 obtained
from Exhibit 15-28; the parameters for Passing Constrained segments are
used.


_Step 6d: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs five parameters _e_ 0 through _e_ 4 obtained
from Exhibit 15-29; the parameters for Passing Constrained segments are
used.


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-17 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


**Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a**
**Passing Lane Segment**

This step is only applicable to passing lane segments. Therefore, Step 7
is skipped.


**Step 8: Calculate Follower Density**

Follower density _FD_ is estimated using Equation 15-35.


**Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density**

There is no passing lane upstream of the analysis segment. Therefore, no
adjustment is needed to follower density and Step 9 is skipped.


**Step 10: Determine LOS**

The segment’s LOS is determined from Exhibit 15-6, using the column for
a higher-speed highway (posted speed limit equal to or greater than 50 mi/h).
With 10.1 followers/mi, the subject direction of travel on the segment
operates at LOS D.


**Discussion**

The estimated FFS and average speed for a flow rate of 800 veh/h are
both above the posted speed limit. This result is reasonable for a flat, straight
segment in this volume range. However, the follower density produces LOS
D operations. This flow rate is large enough to produce fairly high levels of
platooning, but not so high as to cause significant reductions in speed. The
combination of a moderately high flow rate and moderately high level of


platooning will result in travelers perceiving a relatively poor level of
service.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2: PASSING CONSTRAINED SEGMENT**
**WITH HORIZONTAL CURVES**

This example problem illustrates the computation of LOS in a single
direction of a curving, 0.75-mi-long Passing Constrained segment in level
terrain.


**The Facts**

The segment to be evaluated has the same general demand and geometric
characteristics as the segment evaluated in Example Problem 1. The
difference is that this segment has horizontal curvature instead of being
straight; otherwise, the same inputs are used as for Example Problem 1.

The segment is split into 11 subsegments, with each subsegment being
either straight (tangent) or curved. Horizontal curvature data for each
subsegment is provided in Exhibit 26-23.

_b_ Determined from Exhibit 15-22, with radius and superelevation as inputs.


**Objective**

Estimate the average speed in the subject direction on the two-lane
highway segment, taking into account the effects of horizontal alignment on
the average speed.


**Step 1: Identify Facility Study Boundaries and Segmentation**

This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The horizontal
alignment does not affect the selection of study boundaries and segmentation.


**Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and** _**d/c**_ **Ratio**

This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The horizontal
alignment does not affect the computation of the demand flow rates.


**Step 3: Determine the Vertical Alignment Classification**

This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The horizontal
alignment does not affect the determination of the vertical alignment
classification.


**Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed**

This step was completed in Example Problem #1. The computed base
FFS applies to the tangent subsegments.


**Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed**

Steps 5a, 5b, and 5c were applied in Example Problem 1 to obtain the
following speed results for the tangent subsegments:

   - Base free-flow speed _BFFS_ = 57.0 mi/h,

   - Tangent free-flow speed _FFS_ = 56.8 mi/h, and

   - Average speed for tangent subsegments _S_ = 53.7 mi/h.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

In this step, the average speed for each subsegment with a horizontal
curve is determined. There are three substeps: ( _a_ ) identifying the horizontal
alignment classification for each subsegment with a horizontal curve, ( _b_ )
calculating the average speed for each subsegment with a horizontal curve,
and ( _c_ ) calculating the adjusted average speed for the segment.


_Step 5d.1: Identify all Horizontal Curves Within the Segment_

In this step the tangent (straight) length, curve radius, and superelevation
are identified for each horizontal curve within the segment. Each curve is
assigned a horizontal alignment classification on the basis of its radius and
percent superelevation, using Exhibit 15-22. The resulting horizontal classes
were indicated previously in Exhibit 26-23. Note that in typical designs, the
crown of the roadway (designed to shed water from the paved way) will
cause the superelevation to vary by direction of travel. Therefore, a curve’s
horizontal class may also vary by direction of travel.


_Step 5d.2: Calculate Average Speed for each Horizontal Curve_
_Within the Segment_

The average speed for a subsegment with horizontal curvature is
determined using Equation 15-12 though Equation 15-15. The process is
demonstrated for Subsegment 2.

Subsegment 2 has a horizontal alignment class of 3 and the BFFS for the
preceding tangent section is 57.0 mi/h. Equation 15-14 is applied to compute
the base free-flow speed for Subsegment 2:


Subsegment 2’s FFS is computed using Equation 15-13:


The slope coefficient _m_ used in the determination of average speed is
computed using Equation 15-15 as follows:


Finally, the average speed of Subsegment 2 is computed by Equation 1512.


Similar computations are performed for the other subsegments with
horizontal curves. The results are presented in Exhibit 26-24.


**Exhibit 26-24: Example Problem 2: Horizontal Curve Average Speed Results**

10 57.0000 56.8725 2.8036 53.7


_Step 5d.3: Calculate Adjusted Average Speed for the Segment_

The speed results for all subsegments are summarized in Exhibit 26-25.


**Exhibit 26-25: Example Problem 2: Average Speeds by Subsegment**


**Subsegment** **Type** **Speed (mi/h)** **Length (ft)**

9 Tangent 53.7 285
10 Horizontal curve 53.7 767.9
11 Tangent 53.7 369
Total 3,960


Equation 15-16 is used to calculate the segment’s adjusted average speed
by taking a length-weighted average of the subsegment speeds.


**Discussion**

Compared to the straight segment studied in Example Problem 1, the
horizontal curvature in the segment studied in Example Problem 2 reduces
the average speed from 53.7 mi/h to 49.5 mi/h, which is close to the
segment’s posted speed limit of 50 mi/h.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3: FACILITY ANALYSIS—LEVEL TERRAIN**

This example problem illustrates the computation of LOS in the
eastbound direction of a straight, 5.5-mi-long two-lane highway in level
terrain. The study facility includes a 1.5-mi-long passing lane and a 0.5-milong passing zone.


**The Facts**

Exhibit 26-26.

Note: *Only required for Passing Zone segments.


The facility has the following additional characteristics:

   - Facility length = 29,040 ft (5.5 mi);

   - No upstream passing lanes;

   - Percent grade = 0%;

   - Horizontal curvature = none;

   - Lane width = 12 ft in all segments;

   - Paved shoulder width = 6 ft in all segments; and

   - Access points = 0 in all segments (for simplification of this problem,
despite variation in segment volume).


**Objective**

Estimate the LOS in the subject direction on the two-lane highway
segment, taking into account the effects of the passing lane and the passing
zone.


**Step 1: Identify Facility Study Boundaries and Segmentation**


The facility was divided into homogeneous segments following the
guidance given in Step 1. The characteristics considered when segmenting
the facility included the ability to pass, lane geometry, grades, lane and
shoulder widths, posted speed limit, traffic demands, adjacent land uses, and
driveways. Each segment was designated as a Passing Constrained, Passing
Zone, or Passing Lane segment following the guidance on Segmentation given
on page 15-4. The resulting segment lengths and designations were shown in
Exhibit 26-26.

Steps 2–9 of the two-lane highway analysis procedure are now followed
for each of the facility’s five segments, starting with the most upstream
segment (Segment 1) and proceeding in sequence to the downstream
segments.


**Segment 1: Passing Constrained Segment**


_Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and d/c Ratio_

Equation 15-1 is used to convert the segment’s hourly demand volume to
a peak 15-min flow rate:


The capacity of a Passing Constrained segment is 1,700 veh/h, as stated
in the description of Step 2 on page 15-18. The demand flow rate is less than
capacity; therefore the calculation process proceeds to Step 3.


_Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification_

According to Exhibit 15-11, a segment with a level grade is assigned a
vertical alignment classification of 1. From Exhibit 15-10, the segment length
of 0.75 mi is between the minimum (0.25 mi) and maximum (3.0 mi) lengths
for a Passing Constrained segment of vertical class 1, and therefore no
adjustment is needed to the segment length.


_Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed_


Because Segment 1 is a Passing Constrained segment, the opposing flow
rate _vo_ is set at 1,500 veh/h in Equation 15-4 for the purposes of computing
FFS. First, the base free-flow speed _BFFS_ is estimated using Equation 15-2.
Next, Equation 15-4 through Equation 15-6 are used to determine factors
relating to lane and shoulder width, access-point density, and heavy-vehicle
percentage, which are used in the estimation of FFS. Finally, the FFS is
estimated by Equation 15-3.


_Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed_

Because the demand flow rate in the subject direction is greater than 100
veh/h, the equations given in Step 5 are used to estimate the average speed.


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ is computed using six coefficients _b_ 0 to _b_ 5, which
are obtained from Exhibit 15-13 for a Passing Constrained segment. For a
segment of vertical class 1, these coefficients are 0.0558, 0.0542, 0.3278,


0.1029, 0, and 0, respectively. Equation 15-8 is then used to determine the
slope coefficient.


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

The power coefficient _p_ is computed using nine coefficients _f_ 0 to _f_ 8,
which are obtained from Exhibit 15-19 for a Passing Constrained segment.
For a segment of vertical class 1, all of these coefficients take on values of 0,
except for _f_ 0 (0.67576), _f_ 3 (0.12060), and _f_ 4 (−0.35919). Equation 15-11 is
then used to calculate _p_ .


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_


The average speed for Segment 1 is calculated using Equation 15-7.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

Because Segment 1 is straight, no adjustment to the speed estimate is
required for horizontal alignment.


_Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers_


_Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity_

Percent followers at capacity for a Passing Constrained segment is
calculated using Equation 15-18, applying eight parameters _b_ 0 to _b_ 7 obtained
from Exhibit 15-24.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity for a Passing Constrained
segment is calculated using Equation 15-20, applying eight parameters _c_ 0 to
_c_ 7 obtained from Exhibit 15-26.


_Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient _m_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs two parameters _d_ 1 and _d_ 2 obtained
from Exhibit 15-28; the parameters for Passing Constrained segments are
used.


_Step 6d: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs five parameters _e_ 0 through _e_ 4 obtained
from Exhibit 15-29; the parameters for Passing Constrained segments are
used.


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-17 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


_Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a_
_Passing Lane Segment_

This step is only applicable to passing lane segments. Therefore, Step 7
is skipped.


_Step 8: Calculate Follower Density_

Follower density _FD_ is estimated using Equation 15-35.


_Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density_

There is no passing lane upstream of Segment 1. Therefore, no adjustment
is needed to follower density and Step 9 is skipped.


_Step 10: Determine LOS_

The segment’s LOS is determined from Exhibit 15-6, using the column for
a higher-speed highway (posted speed limit equal to or greater than 50 mi/h).
With 10.7 followers/mi/ln, Segment 1 operates at LOS D in the analysis
direction of travel.


**Segment 2: Passing Lane Segment**


_Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and d/c Ratio_

Equation 15-1 is used to convert the segment’s hourly demand volume to
a peak 15-min flow rate:


From Exhibit 15-5, the capacity of a Passing Lane segment of vertical
class 1 with 8% heavy vehicles is 1,500 veh/h. The demand flow rate is less
than capacity; therefore the calculation process proceeds to Step 3.


_Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification_

According to Exhibit 15-11, a segment with a level grade is assigned a
vertical alignment classification of 1. From Exhibit 15-10, the segment length
of 1.5 mi is between the minimum (0.5 mi) and maximum (3.0 mi) lengths for
a Passing Lane segment of vertical class 1, and therefore no adjustment is
needed to the segment length.


_Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed_

Because Segment 2 is a Passing Lane segment, the opposing flow rate _vo_
is set at 0 veh/h in Equation 15-4 for the purposes of computing FFS.
Otherwise, the computations are the same as for Segment 1.


_Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed_


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ is computed by Equation 15-8, applying six
coefficients _b_ 0 to _b_ 5, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-14 for a Passing
Lane segment. This exhibit references Equation 15-9 to calculate _b_ 3 and
Equation 15-10 to calculate _b_ 4, and directly provides numerical values for
the other coefficients.

The calculation of the _b_ 3 coefficient requires four additional coefficients,
_c_ 0 through _c_ 3, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-16 for Passing Lane
segments. The segment has vertical class 1; therefore _c_ 1 takes a value of
0.2667, while the other coefficients are 0.


The calculation of the _b_ 4 coefficient requires four additional coefficients,
_d_ 0 through _d_ 3, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-18 for Passing Lane
segments. The segment has vertical class 1; therefore _d_ 1 takes a value of
0.1252, while the other coefficients are 0.


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

The power coefficient _p_ is computed by Equation 15-11, applying nine
coefficients _f_ 0 to _f_ 8, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-20 for a Passing
Lane segment.


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_

The average speed for Segment 2 is calculated using Equation 15-7.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

Because Segment 2 is straight, no adjustment to the speed estimate is
required for horizontal alignment.


_Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers_


_Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity_

Percent followers at capacity for a Passing Lane segment is calculated
using Equation 15-19, applying eight parameters _b_ 0 to _b_ 7 obtained from
Exhibit 15-25.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity for a Passing Lane segment is
calculated using Equation 15-21, applying eight parameters _c_ 0 to _c_ 7 obtained


from Exhibit 15-27.


_Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient _m_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs two parameters _d_ 1 and _d_ 2 obtained
from Exhibit 15-28; the parameters for Passing Lane segments are used.


_Step 6d: Calculate the Power Coefficient_


Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs five parameters _e_ 0 through _e_ 4 obtained
from Exhibit 15-29; the parameters for Passing Lane segments are used.


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-17 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


_Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a_
_Passing Lane Segment_


_Step 7a: Calculate the Flow Rate in Each Lane of the Passing_
_Lane Segment_

Equation 15-24 through Equation 15-27 are applied as follows.


_Step 7b: Calculate the Percentage of Heavy Vehicles in Each_
_Lane of the Passing Lane Segment_

Equation 15-28 through Equation 15-30 are applied as follows.


_Step 7c: Calculate the Average Speed in Each Lane of the_
_Passing Lane Segment_

Applying the equations and passing lane coefficient tables of Step 5
(Estimate the Average Speed), with the corresponding flow rate and heavy
vehicle percentage for each lane yields:

_Sinit_FL_ = 60.7 mi/h; and

_Sinit_SL_ = 60.6 mi/h.


The average speed lane differential adjustment is calculated with
Equation 15-31.


Next, the average speed for each lane at the passing lane segment
midpoint is calculated with Equation 15-32 and Equation 15-33.


_Step 7d: Calculate the Percent Followers in Each Lane of the_
_Passing Lane Segment_


Applying the equations and passing lane coefficient tables of Step 6
(Estimate the Percent Followers), with the corresponding flow rate and
heavy vehicle percentage for each lane yields


_PFPLmid_FL_ = 44.5%, and

_PFPLmid_SL_ = 35.6%.


_Step 8: Calculate Follower Density_

The follower density, _FD_, for the midpoint of the passing lane segment is
estimated using Equation 15-34.


The follower density, _FD_, for the endpoint of the passing lane segment is
estimated using Equation 15-35.


_Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density_

There is no passing lane upstream of segment 2. Therefore, no adjustment
is needed to follower density for this segment. However, before proceeding
to the analysis of the downstream segments, the effective length of this
passing lane segment is determined. The first criterion for identifying the
passing lane effective length, that is, the point at which the percent
improvement to percent followers goes to zero, is applied by testing different


values of _DownstreamDistance_ in Equation 15-36 until the value of
_%ImprovePF_ goes to zero. The resulting effective length is 14.4 mi.


The second criterion for identifying the passing lane effective length, that
is, the point at which the downstream adjusted follower density reaches 95%
of the follower density immediately prior to the start of the passing lane, is
applied by testing different values of _DownstreamDistance_ in Equation 1536 through Equation 15-38. The target value for _FDadj_ is 95% of the
follower density for segment 1, or 0.95 × 10.7 = 10.17 followers/mi/ln. This
target value is reached at a downstream distance of 8.1 mi.


The passing lane effective length is taken as the shorter of the two values,
in this case 8.1 mi. The remaining downstream segments (3, 4, and 5) are all
within the passing lane’s effective length; therefore, an adjusted follower
density will be calculated for each of these segments.


_Step 10: Determine LOS_

From Exhibit 15-6, for a higher-speed highway, the LOS is B.


**Segment 3: Passing Constrained Segment**


_Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and d/c Ratio_

Equation 15-1 is used to convert the segment’s hourly demand volume to
a peak 15-min flow rate:


The demand flow rate is less than the capacity of a Passing Constrained
segment (1,700 veh/h); therefore, the calculation process proceeds to Step 3.


_Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification_

According to Exhibit 15-11, a segment with a level grade is assigned a
vertical alignment classification of 1. From Exhibit 15-10, the segment length
of 1.0 mi is between the minimum (0.25 mi) and maximum (3.0 mi) lengths
for a Passing Constrained segment of vertical class 1, and therefore no
adjustment is needed to the segment length.


_Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed_

Segment 3 is a Passing Constrained segment similar to Segment 1. The
only aspect in which it differs from Segment 1 is its length, which is used in
Equation 15-4 to determine the _a_ coefficient. However, the length is


multiplied by zero in Equation 15-4 and therefore does not affect the final
result. The calculated FFS is the same as Segment 1, 62.43 mi/h.


_Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed_


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ is computed using Equation 15-8. The
calculation is the same as for Segment 1, except that the segment length is
different.


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

The power coefficient _p_ is computed using Equation 15-11. The
calculation is the same as for Segment 1, except that the segment length is
different.


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_

The average speed for Segment 3 is calculated using Equation 15-7.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

Because segment 3 is straight, no adjustment to the speed estimate is
required for horizontal alignment.


_Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers_


_Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity_

Percent followers at capacity for a Passing Constrained segment is
calculated using Equation 15-18. The calculation is the same as for Segment
1, except that the segment length is different.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity for a Passing Constrained
segment is calculated using Equation 15-20. The calculation is the same as
for Segment 1, except that the segment length is different.


_Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient _m_ .


_Step 6d: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ .


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-17 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


_Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a_
_Passing Lane Segment_

This step is only applicable to passing lane segments. Therefore, Step 7
is skipped.


_Step 8: Calculate Follower Density_

Follower density _FD_ is estimated using Equation 15-35.


_Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density_

As previously determined, this segment is within the effective length of
the upstream passing lane; therefore, an adjusted follower density value is
calculated. The downstream distance used in these calculations is 2.5 mi
(passing lane segment length + subject segment length).

Equation 15-36 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
percent followers.


Equation 15-37 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
average speed.


Equation 15-38 is used to determine the adjusted follower density.


This adjusted follower density result is used in Steps 10 and 11.


_Step 10: Determine LOS_

From Exhibit 15-6, for a higher-speed highway, the LOS is D (barely).


**Segment 4: Passing Zone Segment**


_Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and d/c Ratio_

Equation 15-1 is used to convert the segment’s hourly demand volume to
a peak 15-min flow rate:


The demand flow rate is less than the capacity of a Passing Zone segment
(1,700 veh/h) and the calculation process can proceed to Step 3. However,
because Segment 4 is a Passing Zone segment, the demand flow rate in the
opposing direction is also required and is calculated as follows:


_Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification_

According to Exhibit 15-11, a segment with a level grade is assigned a
vertical alignment classification of 1. From Exhibit 15-10, the segment length
of 0.5 mi is between the minimum (0.25 mi) and maximum (2.0 mi) lengths
for a Passing Zone segment of vertical class 1, and therefore no adjustment is
needed to the segment length.


_Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed_

The determination of the FFS for Segment 4 is similar to that of the
previous segments, as they have similar geometric characteristics. It differs
only in terms of length (which does not play a role in determining FFS for
level segments) and percent heavy vehicles. Therefore, from Equation 15-3:


_Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed_


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ is computed using Equation 15-8. Passing Zone
segments use the same coefficients in this equation as do Passing Constrained
segments. However, the values for FFS, opposing flow rate, segment length,
and percent heavy vehicles are different for Segment 4.


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

The power coefficient _p_ is computed using Equation 15-11.


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_

The average speed for Segment 4 is calculated using Equation 15-7.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

Because segment 4 is straight, no adjustment to the speed estimate is
required for horizontal alignment.


_Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers_


_Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity_

Percent followers at capacity for a Passing Zone segment is calculated
using Equation 15-18. The coefficients used in the equation are the same ones
used for Passing Constrained segments.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity for a Passing Constrained
segment is calculated using Equation 15-20.


_Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient _m_ .

Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ .


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-17 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


_Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a_
_Passing Lane Segment_

This step is only applicable to passing lane segments. Therefore, Step 7
is skipped.


_Step 8: Calculate Follower Density_

Follower density _FD_ is estimated using Equation 15-35.


_Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density_

As previously determined, this segment is within the effective length of
the upstream passing lane; therefore, an adjusted follower density value is
calculated. The downstream distance used in these calculations is the sum of
the lengths of Segments 2, 3, and 4, which is 3.0 mi.

Equation 15-36 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
percent followers.


Equation 15-37 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
average speed.


Equation 15-38 is used to determine the adjusted follower density.


This adjusted follower density result is used in Steps 10 and 11.


_Step 10: Determine LOS_

From Exhibit 15-6, for a higher-speed highway, the LOS is D (barely).


**Segment 5: Passing Constrained Segment**


_Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity and d/c Ratio_

Equation 15-1 is used to convert the segment’s hourly demand volume to
a peak 15-min flow rate:


The demand flow rate is less than the capacity of a Passing Constrained
segment (1,700 veh/h); therefore, the calculation process proceeds to Step 3.


_Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification_

According to Exhibit 15-11, a segment with a level grade is assigned a
vertical alignment classification of 1. From Exhibit 15-10, the segment length
of 1.75 mi is between the minimum (0.25 mi) and maximum (3.0 mi) lengths
for a Passing Constrained segment of vertical class 1, and therefore no
adjustment is needed to the segment length.


_Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed_

Segment 5 is a Passing Constrained segment similar to Segments 1 and 3.
The only aspect in which it differs from those segments is its length, which is
used in Equation 15-4 to determine the _a_ coefficient, where it is multiplied
by zero and therefore does not affect the final result. The calculated FFS is
therefore the same as Segments 1 and 3, 62.43 mi/h.


_Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed_


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ is computed using Equation 15-8.


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

The power coefficient _p_ is computed using Equation 15-11.


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_

The average speed for Segment 5 is calculated using Equation 15-7.


_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

Because Segment 5 is straight, no adjustment to the speed estimate is
required for horizontal alignment.


_Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers_

Percent followers at capacity for a Passing Constrained segment is
calculated using Equation 15-18.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

_Step 6d: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ .


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-18 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


_Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a_
_Passing Lane Segment_

This step is only applicable to passing lane segments. Therefore, Step 7
is skipped.


_Step 8: Calculate Follower Density_

Follower density _FD_ is estimated using Equation 15-35.


_Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density_

As previously determined, this segment is within the effective length of
the upstream passing lane; therefore, an adjusted follower density value is
calculated. The downstream distance used in these calculations is the sum of
the lengths of Segments 2–5, 4.75 mi.

Equation 15-36 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
percent followers.


Equation 15-37 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
average speed.


Equation 15-38 is used to determine the adjusted follower density.


This adjusted follower density result is used in Steps 10 and 11.


_Step 10: Determine LOS_

From Exhibit 15-6, for a higher-speed highway, the LOS is D.


**Step 11: Facility Analysis**

The average follower density and the average LOS for the facility are
computed by averaging the length-weighted segment densities using Equation
15-39.


From Exhibit 15-6, for a higher-speed highway, the facility LOS is C.
Exhibit 26-27 summarizes LOS results for each segment and the facility as a
whole.


**Exhibit 26-27: Example Problem 3: LOS Results**


**Segment** **Length (mi)** **Type** **Follower Density (followers/mi)** **LOS**

1 0.75 Passing Constrained 10.7 D
2 1.50 Passing Lane 2.9 B
3 1.00 Passing Constrained 8.2 D
4 0.50 Passing Zone 8.2 D
5 1.75 Passing Constrained 8.8 D
5.50 Facility 7.3 C


**Discussion**

The non–passing lane segments all operate at LOS D and the passing lane
segment operates at LOS B. The operating conditions within the passing lane
segment and its benefits several miles downstream result in an overall
facility LOS of C.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 4: FACILITY ANALYSIS – MOUNTAIN ROAD**

This example problem illustrates the computation of the LOS in the
eastbound direction of a 5.1-mi-long two-lane highway in mountainous
terrain with two 0.5-mi-long passing lanes. Grades reach 6% and there are a
series of reverse curves that constrain speeds.

This highway is a popular summer and winter recreational area access
route. It experiences heavy snowfall each winter. The road is extensively


plowed during winter and chains are required during winter storms. The
Chapter 15 method is not appropriate for the analysis of winter operations.

This analysis focuses on summer, dry weather operations. Summer
volumes are higher than winter volumes.


**The Facts**

A diagram of the study facility, showing its six segments, is provided in
Exhibit 26-28. The study direction (eastbound) starts in the top left of the
figure and proceeds to the bottom center.


**Exhibit 26-28: Example Problem 4: Facility Diagram**


Exhibit 26-29 provides volume and speed data for the facility, while
Exhibit 26-30 provides grade and horizontal curve data. Tangent sections are
either straight or have horizontal curves with radii greater than 2,550 ft.
Segment 2 has a series of seven reverse curves of similar radius and central
angle. To reduce repetitive computations that would produce the same
estimated speed, they have been combined into a single long, curved


subsegment. Segment 3 contains a short passing lane 910 ft (0.17 mi) in
length. Because this length is shorter than the minimum passing lane lengths
given in Exhibit 15-10 (i.e., is too short to be effectively used as a passing
lane), the passing lane is ignored. Segment 3 is treated as a Passing
Constrained segment instead, following the guidance on page 15-17.

The facility has the following additional characteristics:


   - Facility length = 26,928 ft (5.1 mi);

   - Not within the effective length of upstream passing lanes;

   - No turnouts;

   - Lane width = 12 ft in all segments;

   - Paved shoulder width = 6 ft in all segments; and

   - Access points = 0 in all segments.


**Objective**

Estimate the LOS in the eastbound direction of the two-lane highway
facility, taking into account the effects of the passing lanes.


**Step 1: Identify Facility Study Boundaries and Segmentation**

The facility was divided into homogeneous segments following the
guidance given in Step 1. The characteristics considered when segmenting
the facility included the ability to pass, lane geometry, grades, lane and
shoulder widths, posted speed limit, traffic demands, adjacent land uses, and
driveways. Each segment was designated as a Passing Constrained, Passing
Zone, or Passing Lane segment following the guidance on Segmentation given
on page 15-4. The resulting segment lengths and designations were shown in
Exhibit 26-29.

Steps 2–10 of the two-lane highway analysis procedure are now
followed for each of the facility’s five segments, starting with the most
upstream segment (Segment 1) and proceeding in sequence to the
downstream segments.


**Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and** _**d/c**_ **Ratio**

Equation 15-1 is used to convert the facility’s hourly demand volume to a
peak 15-min flow rate. Each segment has the same demand volume and thus
the same flow rate.


The capacity of a Passing Constrained segment is 1,700 veh/h, as stated
in the description of Step 2 on page 15-18, while the capacity of a Passing
Lane segment with vertical class 1 and 8% heavy vehicles is 1,500 veh/h,
from Exhibit 15-5. The demand flow rate is less than these capacities;
therefore the calculation process proceeds to Step 3.


**Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification**

Each segment is assigned a vertical alignment classification on the basis
of Exhibit 15-11. The results are shown in Exhibit 26-31.


**Exhibit 26-31: Example Problem 4: Vertical Alignment Classifications by Segment**


**Segment** **Length (mi)** **Grade (%)** **Vertical Class**

1 1.3 4 4
2 1.0 6 5
3 0.5 6 4
4 1.3 4 4
5 0.5 −3 1
6 0.5 −3 1


From Exhibit 15-10, all segment lengths lie between the minimum and
maximum lengths for their respective segment types. Therefore, no
adjustment is needed to any segment length.


**Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed**

The FFS is computed using Equation 15-2 through Equation 15-6. The
process will be demonstrated for Segment 1 and the results presented for the
remaining segments.

Because Segment 1 is a Passing Constrained segment, the opposing flow
rate _vo_ is set at 1,500 veh/h in Equation 15-4 for the purposes of computing
FFS. First, the base free-flow speed _BFFS_ is estimated using Equation 15-2.
Next, Equation 15-5 and Equation 15-6 are used to determine factors relating
to lane and shoulder width and access-point density, which are used in the
estimation of FFS.


Unlike the previous example problems, Segment 1 is not level and
therefore the value of the coefficient _a_ does not reduce to 0.0333. Equation
15-4 is used to calculate _a._ This equation uses six coefficients _a_ 0 to _a_ 5,
which are obtained from Exhibit 15-12.


Finally, the FFS is estimated by Equation 15-3.


Exhibit 26-32 summarizes the FFS results for all segments.


**Exhibit 26-32: Example Problem 4: Free-Flow Speed Results**

**Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed**

Because the demand flow rate in the subject direction is greater than 100
veh/h, the equations given in Step 5 are used to estimate the average speed.
The process is demonstrated for Segment 1, with results summarized for all
segments afterwards.


_Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

The slope coefficient _m_ is computed using Equation 15-8. This equation
requires six coefficients _b_ 0 to _b_ 5, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-13 for
a Passing Constrained segment. The exhibit references Equation 15-9 to
calculate _b_ 3 and Equation 15-10 to calculate _b_ 4, and directly provides
numerical values for the other coefficients.

Equation 15-9 is used to determine the segment length coefficient _b_ 3. It
uses four coefficients _c_ 0 to _c_ 3, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-15 for a
Passing Constrained segment.


Equation 15-10 is used to determine the segment length coefficient _b_ 3. It
uses four coefficients _d_ 0 to _d_ 3, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-17 for a
Passing Constrained segment.


With all the coefficients now determined, the slope coefficient _m_ can be
calculated:


_Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient_


The power coefficient _p_ is computed using Equation 15-11. This equation
requires nine coefficients _f_ 0 to _f_ 8, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-19 for
a Passing Constrained segment.


_Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment_

The average speed is calculated using Equation 15-7.


Exhibit 26-33 summarizes the average speed results for all segments.


**Exhibit 26-33: Example Problem 4: Unadjusted Average Speed Results**








|Variable|Segment<br>1 2 3 4 5 6|
|---|---|

_Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment_

In this step, the average speed for each subsegment with a horizontal
curve is determined. There are three substeps: ( _a_ ) identifying the horizontal
alignment classification for each subsegment with a horizontal curve, ( _b_ )
calculating the average speed for each subsegment with a horizontal curve,
and ( _c_ ) calculating the adjusted average speed for the segment. The process
will be demonstrated for Segment 1, with results summarized for the other
segments afterwards. Only Segments 1, 2, and 4 contain horizontal curves.


_Step 5d.1: Identify all Horizontal Curves Within the Segment_


From the facts given previously, the horizontal curve in subsegment 1b
has a radius of 350 ft and a superelevation of 2%. From Exhibit 15-22, it is
assigned a horizontal alignment class of 4.


_Step 5d.2: Calculate Average Speed for each Horizontal Curve_
_Within the Segment_

The average speed for a subsegment with horizontal curvature is
determined using Equation 15-12 though Equation 15-15. First, Equation 1514 is applied to compute the base free-flow speed:


Next, the FFS is computed using Equation 15-13:


The slope coefficient _m_ used in the determination of average speed is
computed using Equation 15-15 as follows:


Finally, the average speed of subsegment 1b is computed by Equation 1512.


_Step 5d.3: Calculate Adjusted Average Speed for the Segment_

Equation 15-16 is used to calculate Segment 1’s adjusted average speed
by taking a length-weighted average of the subsegment speeds.


Exhibit 26-34 presents the calculation results for adjusted average speed
for each segment.


**Exhibit 26-34: Example Problem 4: Adjusted Average Speed Results**


|Variable|Segment<br>1 2 3 4 5 6|
|---|---|

Note: - = not applicable, no horizontal curve in the segment.


**Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers**

The calculation of percent followers is demonstrated for Segment 1, with
results for all segments presented afterwards.


_Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity_

Percent followers at capacity for a Passing Constrained segment is
calculated using Equation 15-18, applying eight parameters _b_ 0 to _b_ 7 obtained
from Exhibit 15-24.


_Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity_

Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity for a Passing Constrained
segment is calculated using Equation 15-20, applying eight parameters _c_ 0 to
_c_ 7 obtained from Exhibit 15-26.


_Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient_

Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient _m_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs two parameters _d_ 1 and _d_ 2 obtained
from Exhibit 15-28; the parameters for Passing Constrained segments are
used.


_Step 6d: Calculate the Power Coefficient_

Equation 15-23 is used to compute the power coefficient _p_ for an
exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent
following at 25% capacity. It employs five parameters _e_ 0 through _e_ 4 obtained
from Exhibit 15-29; the parameters for Passing Constrained segments are
used.


_Step 6e: Calculate Percent Followers_

Equation 15-17 is used to compute percent followers _PF_ .


Exhibit 26-35 presents the percent followers results for all segments.


**Step 7: Calculate Additional Performance Measure Values for a**
**Passing Lane Segment**

This step applies only to Segment 5, the passing lane segment. Equation
15-24 through Equation 15-33 are applied, as was demonstrated for the
passing lane segment in Example Problem 3. The results that will be used in
the segment midpoint follower density calculation are as follows:

_FlowRateSL_ = 654 veh/h/ln;

_FlowRateSL_ = 568 veh/h/ln;

_SPLmid_FL_ = 61.1 mi/h;

_SPLmid_SL_ = 56.8 mi/h;

_PFPLmid_FL_ = 63.1%; and

_PFPLmid_SL_ = 55.9%.


**Step 8: Calculate Follower Density**

Follower density, _FD_, is estimated using Equation 15-35. For Segment 1,
the calculation is performed as follows:


The follower density, _FD_, for the midpoint of the passing lane segment is
estimated using Equation 15-34.

**Step 9: Determine Potential Adjustment to Follower Density**

Segment 5 is a passing lane. Therefore, an adjustment may be needed to
follower density in the downstream segment, Segment 6. Following the same
process outlined in Example Problem 3, the effective length is determined to
be 4.4 mi (the adjusted follower density within 95% of the upstream
follower density controls the effective length in this case).

Because the end of the downstream, and last, segment is within the
effective length of the passing lane, Equation 15-36 through Equation 15-38
are used to calculate the adjusted follower density for Segment 6. The
downstream distance used in these calculations is 1.0 mi (Segment 5 length +
Segment 6 length).

Equation 15-36 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
percent followers in Segment 6 as a result of the upstream passing lane.


Equation 15-37 is used to determine the percentage improvement to
average speed in Segment 6 as a result of the upstream passing lane, and
Equation 15-38 is used to determine the adjusted follower density.


This adjusted follower density result is used in Steps 10 and 11.


**Step 10: Determine LOS**

Each segment’s LOS is determined from Exhibit 15-6, using the column
for a higher-speed highway (posted speed limit equal to or greater than 50
mi/h). The follower density in all segments exceeds 12 followers/mi;
therefore, all segments operate at LOS E.


**Step 11: Facility Analysis**

The average follower density and the average LOS for the facility are
computed by averaging the length-weighted segment densities using Equation
15-39.


From Exhibit 15-6, for a higher-speed highway, the facility LOS is E.
Exhibit 26-36 summarizes LOS results for each segment and the facility as a
whole.


**Exhibit 26-36: Example Problem 4: LOS Results**


**Segment** **Length (mi)** **Type** **Follower Density (followers/mi)** **LOS**

1 1.3 Passing Constrained 22.2 E
2 1.0 Passing Constrained 24.9 E
3 0.5 Passing Constrained 20.2 E
4 1.3 Passing Constrained 21.6 E
5 0.5 Passing Lane 6.2 C
6 0.5 Passing Constrained 13.2 E
5.1 Facility 20.0 E


**Discussion**

The main conclusions of this analysis are:

   - The tight 350-ft radius horizontal curve at the end of Segment 1
significantly reduces speeds at the end of that segment. The other
segments are comparatively unaffected by their horizontal curvature.

   - The 6% upgrade significantly affects speeds and percent followers.
The Passing Lane segment significantly reduces percent followers on
the downstream segment. However, the improvement is not large
enough to change the LOS from E to D for this mountainous highway.

   - The percent followers and the follower density are high on this
facility, resulting in LOS E. The last segment of the facility (a
downgrade following a 0.5-mi passing lane) is slightly over the
threshold for LOS E. Average speeds for the non-passing lane
segments range from 44 mi/h to 56 mi/h. Within the passing lane, the
average speeds range from 56 to 61 mi/h across the two lanes. The
demand/capacity ratio varies from 0.72 to 0.87 during the summer
peak hour.


The long upgrade extending across several segments generates
interactions across the segments that are not well modeled by this
macroscopic analysis method for evaluating facilities. Consequently,
microsimulation would be recommended to verify and potentially refine the
results.

As noted in The Facts section at the start of this example problem,
Segment 3 contains a 910-ft passing lane that is too short to provide a
substantial operational benefit. One could analyze the effect of extending the
passing lane length to 0.5 mi, assuming it is actually feasible to extend the
passing lane in this mountainous terrain. In that case, Segment 3 would be
analyzed as a Passing Lane segment, and the follower density in Segment 4
would be adjusted to reflect the effects of the passing lane. Another passing
lane starts in Segment 5; therefore, the analysis of the effects of the Segment 3
passing lane would not be carried past Segment 4. With the improved passing
lane, the follower density for the facility would improve to 17.6
followers/mi/ln, although this still yields LOS E.


**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5: TWO-LANE HIGHWAY BICYCLE LOS**

A segment of two-lane highway (without passing lanes) is being
evaluated for potential widening, realigning, and repaving. Analyze the
impacts of the proposed project on the bicycle LOS (BLOS) in the peak
direction.


**The Facts**

The roadway currently has the following characteristics:

   - Lane width = 12 ft,

   - Shoulder width = 2 ft,

   - Pavement rating = 3 (fair),

   - Posted speed limit = 50 mi/h,

   - Hourly directional volume = 500 veh/h (no growth is expected),

   - Percentage of heavy vehicles = 5%,

   - PHF = 0.90, and


   - No on-highway parking.

The proposed roadway design has the following characteristics:

   - Lane width = 12 ft,

   - Shoulder width = 6 ft,

   - Pavement rating = 5 (very good),

   - Posted speed limit = 55 mi/h, and

   - No on-highway parking.


**Step 1: Gather Input Data**

All data needed to perform the analysis are listed above.


**Step 2: Calculate the Directional Flow Rate in the Outside Lane**

Using the hourly directional volume and the PHF, calculate the
directional demand flow rate with Equation 15-40. Because this is a twolane highway segment without a passing lane, the number of directional lanes
_N_ is 1. Because traffic volumes are not expected to grow over the period of
the analysis, _vOL_ is the same for both current and future conditions.


**Step 3: Calculate the Effective Width**

For current conditions, the hourly directional demand _V_ is greater than
160 veh/h and the paved shoulder width is 2 ft; therefore, Equation 15-43
and Equation 15-44 are used to determine the effective width of the outside
lane. Under future conditions, the paved shoulder width will increase to 6 ft;
therefore, Equation 15-42 and Equation 15-44 are used.

For current conditions,


Under the proposed design,


**Step 4: Calculate the Effective Speed Factor**

Equation 15-46 is used to calculate the effective speed factor. Under
current conditions,


Under the proposed design,


**Step 5: Determine the LOS**

Equation 15-47 is used to calculate the BLOS score, which is then used
in Exhibit 15-7 to determine the LOS. Under existing conditions,


Therefore, the BLOS for existing conditions is LOS F. Use of the same
process for the proposed design results in the following:


The corresponding LOS for the proposed design is LOS D, close to the
boundary of LOS C ( _BLOS_ = 3.50).


**Discussion**

Although the posted speed would increase as a result of the proposed
design, this negative impact on bicyclists would be more than offset by the
proposed shoulder widening, as indicated by the improvement from LOS F to
LOS D.

### **APPENDIX B: WORK ZONES ON TWO-LANE HIGHWAYS**

This appendix presents a method for estimating the capacity and
operation of work zones on two-lane highways when one of the two lanes is
closed. This method is based on research conducted by National Cooperative
Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 03-107 ( _B-1_ ).

Work zones along two-lane highways can take three forms:

1. _Shoulder closure._ Work activity is limited to the shoulder of one
direction of travel and does not require lane reconfiguration. In this
case, only the direction of travel adjacent to the work zone is slightly
affected.

2. _Lane shift._ Work activity extends beyond the shoulder, but both
directions of travel can be accommodated with a lane shift that
utilizes the opposite paved shoulder.

3. _Lane closure._ Work activity requires the closure of one of the two
lanes. Flaggers or temporary traffic signals are used to alternately
serve one direction of travel at a time. Both directions of travel can
be significantly affected.

The method presented in this appendix addresses the third scenario—
lane closure—as it has the greatest impact on traffic operations.


**CONCEPTS**

A lane closure on a two-lane highway converts traffic flow from an
uninterrupted to an interrupted condition. With traffic control devices
(flaggers or signals) provided at each end, the operation of the lane closure
can be described in terms similar to those used for a signalized intersection:

   - _Capacity_ is the number of vehicles that can be processed through the
work zone per cycle or per hour. It can be determined based on the
saturation flow rate at the control points and the traffic control “cycle
length.”


   - _Cycle length_ is determined by the flagging operations or signal timing
at each control point and the time required to travel through the work
zone. Travel time is dependent on the average travel speed of the
platoons traveling through the work zone. Factors that may influence
travel speed include posted speed limit, use of a pilot car, heavyvehicle percentage, grade, intensity of construction activity, lane
width, lateral distance to the work activity, and lighting conditions
(day versus night).

Performance measures, including delay and queue length, can be
calculated by using capacity and cycle length.


**WORK ZONE CAPACITY**

The methodology for estimating the capacity of a work zone on a twolane highway with one lane closed is analogous to the capacity calculation
for a two-phase signalized intersection. Average travel speed is estimated
from a regression model developed through observations of two directions of
travel at three work zones ( _B-1_ ).


**Step 1: Collect Data**

For a typical capacity calculation, the analyst must specify traffic
information (including traffic demands, travel speed, and heavy-vehicle
percentage), roadway geometric configuration (e.g., lane width, lateral
clearance, speed limit), and work zone data (including work zone length,
signal green time, and traffic control plan).

A basic traffic flagger control process for a two-lane highway work zone
involving a lane closure is shown in Exhibit 26-B1. Direction 1 refers to the
travel direction whose lane is blocked by the work zone; Direction 2 refers
to the travel direction with the open lane.


**Exhibit 26-B1: Traffic Control for a Two-Lane Highway Work Zone Involving a Lane**
**Closure**


Source: Schoen et al. ( _B-1_ ).


Some data, such as average travel speed, saturation flow rate, and green
interval length, may be difficult to collect in the field. In Steps 2–4, the
mathematical models that can be used to estimate these data are presented.
Analysts must note that, for capacity calculations, field data are always more
desirable to use when available.

A procedure is given in Section 6 of Chapter 31, Signalized
Intersections: Supplemental, for determining the saturation flow rate of a
signalized intersection. This procedure involves counting and timing the
number of queue discharge vehicles that pass through an intersection to
determine the saturated vehicle headway. As two-lane highway work zone
traffic control typically has a much longer cycle length than a typical
signalized intersection, the time period for gathering saturation flow data is
recommended to be 30–60 min. Of course, a longer time period is generally
more desirable when possible. The work zone capacity can then be


determined from the measured saturation flow rate and the effective green–
to–cycle length ratio.

Unlike the core two-lane highway procedure described in Chapter 15, the
work zone procedure requires that demand volumes be adjusted for the
effects of heavy vehicles and grades, using Equation 26-B1.


**Equation 26-B1:**


where

_vi_ = demand flow rate (pc/h);

_i_ = “d” (analysis direction) or “o” (opposing direction);

_Vi_ = demand volume for direction _i_ (veh/h);

_PHF_ = peak hour factor (decimal);

_fg_ = grade adjustment factor, from Exhibit 26-B2 or Exhibit 26-B3;
and

_fHV_ = heavy vehicle adjustment factor, from Equation 26-B2.


_Grade Adjustment Factor Calculation_

Exhibit 26-B2 shows grade adjustment factors for extended segments of
level and rolling terrain, as well as for specific downgrades. Exhibit 26-B2
is entered with the one-direction demand flow rate _vvph_, in vehicles per hour.
If demand is expressed as an hourly volume, it must be divided by the PHF
( _vvph_ = _V/PHF_ ) to obtain the appropriate factor. Other adjustment factor
tables associated with Equation 26-B1 are entered with this value as well.

Exhibit 26-B3 shows grade adjustment factors for specific upgrades. The
negative impact of upgrades on two-lane highway speeds increases as both
the severity of the upgrade and its length increase. The impact declines as
demand flow rate increases. At higher demand flow rates, lower speeds
would already result, and the additional impact of the upgrades is less
severe.

_Heavy Vehicle Adjustment Factor Calculation_

Determining the heavy vehicle adjustment factor is a two-step process:

1. Passenger car equivalents are found for trucks _(ET_ ) and recreational
vehicles (RVs) ( _ER_ ) under prevailing conditions.

2. A heavy vehicle adjustment factor is computed from the passenger
car equivalents with Equation 26-B2.


**Equation 26-B2:**


where

_fHV_ = heavy vehicle adjustment factor,

_PT_ = proportion of trucks in the traffic stream (decimal),

_PR_ = proportion of RVs in the traffic stream (decimal),

_ET_ = passenger car equivalent for trucks, and

_ER_ = passenger car equivalent for RVs.


The passenger car equivalent is the number of passenger cars displaced
from the traffic stream by one truck or RV. Passenger car equivalents are
defined for:

   - Extended sections of general level or rolling terrain,

   - Specific upgrades, and

   - Specific downgrades.

Exhibit 26-B4 contains passenger car equivalents for trucks and RVs in
general terrain segments and for specific downgrades, which are treated as
level terrain in the lower-speed situations associated with work zones.

Note: Interpolation to the nearest 0.1 is recommended.


Exhibit 26-B5 and Exhibit 26-B6 show passenger car equivalents for
trucks and RVs, respectively, on specific upgrades.


**Step 2: Estimate Average Travel Speed**

A simple estimation of average travel speed is obtained as follows.
Speeds for Directions 1 and 2 are calculated by Equation 26-B3 and
Equation 26-B4, respectively. Research on two-lane highway work zones ( _B-_
_1_ ) found that Direction 2 (i.e., the direction whose lane is not closed)
consistently had higher average speeds than Direction 1.


**Equation 26-B3:**


**Equation 26-B4:**


where

_Si_ = average travel speed in direction _i_ (mi/h),

_Spl_ = posted speed limit for the two-lane highway segment (mi/h),

_fLS_ = adjustment for lane and shoulder width from Equation 15-5
(mi/h), and

_fA_ = adjustment for access-point density from Equation 15-6 (mi/h).


For two-lane highway work zones, these equations provide a constant
speed reduction of 2.4 mi/h in all conditions.

Note: Interpolation in this exhibit is not recommended.


**Step 3: Estimate Saturation Flow Rate**

If the saturation flow rate is not measured in the field, a directional
saturation flow rate can be estimated by using Equation 26-B5 with Equation
26-B6 and Equation 26-B7.


**Equation 26-B5:**


with


**Equation 26-B6:**


**Equation 26-B7:**


where

_si_ = saturation flow rate for direction _i_ (pc/h);

_hi_ = adjusted time headway for direction _i_ (s);

_h_ 0 = base saturation headway (s/pc) = 3,600/1,900 = 1.89 s/pc;

_f_ speed _,i_ = speed adjustment for direction _i_ (decimal); and

_Si_ = average travel speed in direction _i_ (mi/h).


**Step 4: Estimate Green Time**

The length of the green interval can be applied directly if a fixed-time
signal is applied at the work zone site. However, most work zones apply
flagger control, for which the green time in each cycle is not fixed. For
flagger control under relatively balanced directional demand conditions, a
simple estimation of optimal directional effective green time can be found by
using Equation 26-B8.


**Equation 26-B8:**


where

_Gopt_ = optimal effective green time for one direction (s), and

_l_ = work zone length (ft)


_l_ = work zone length (ft).


To ensure traffic can be fully discharged in two directions, directional
effective green-time lengths must satisfy Equation 26-B9 with Equation 26B10.


**Equation 26-B9:**


with


**Equation 26-B10:**


where

_Gi_ = effective green time for direction _i_ (s),

_Gi,min_ = minimum effective green time for direction _i_ (s),

_si_ = saturation flow rate for direction _i_ (pc/h),

_vi_ = demand flow rate for direction _i_ (pc/h),

_C_ = cycle length (s),

_Si,fps_ = average travel speed in direction _i_ (ft/s) = ( _Si_ × 5,280
ft/mi)/(3,600 s/h),

_Si_ = average travel speed in direction _i_ (mi/h), and

_LS_ = start-up lost time (s).


**Step 5: Calculate Capacity**

Directional capacity is calculated by Equation 26-B11.


**Equation 26-B11:**


where

_ci_ = capacity for direction _i_ (pc/h),

_si_ = saturation flow rate for direction _i_ (pc/h),

_Gi_ = effective green time for direction _i_ (s), and

_C_ = cycle length (s).


The _start-up lost time_, the elapsed time between the last vehicle in the
opposing direction exiting the work zone and the entry of the first queued
vehicle traveling in the subject direction, is assumed to be independent of
traffic direction, as the two directions follow the same traffic control plan. A
default value of 2 s for each direction is recommended.

The total capacity _c_ total (in passenger cars per hour) can be calculated by
summing the two directional capacities, as shown in Equation 26-B12.


**Equation 26-B12:**


**QUEUING AND DELAY ANALYSIS**

The previous steps provide a simple procedure to check two-lane
highway work zone capacity. In practice, it might also be useful to have
performance data such as delay and queuing. Users can apply the model to
determine the optimal control plan while minimizing the vehicle delay and
queuing data.

A simple way to estimate vehicle delay and queue length is by assuming
deterministic traffic flow for both directions. Exhibit 26-B7 shows the


deterministic queuing diagram for a two-lane highway work zone. Although
more accurate estimates can be calculated from microscopic simulations that
incorporate random processes, these estimates might be difficult to
accomplish in practice because of the extra time and resources required.
Therefore, by a similar procedure to that used in Chapter 19 for signalized
intersection control delay estimation, the incremental delay caused by
random arrivals is added to the deterministic queuing delay associated with
the work zone. The interval _gi_ shown in the exhibit is the portion of the green
time with saturated departures.

The maximum queue length for each direction _Qi,max_ (in passenger cars)
is the height of the triangles in the queue length area of the exhibit. These
lengths can be calculated by Equation 26-B13 and Equation 26-B14 for
Directions 1 and 2, respectively.


**Equation 26-B13:**


**Equation 26-B14:**


**Exhibit 26-B7: Directional Queueing Diagram for a Two-Lane Highway Lane-Closure**
**Work Zone**


Source: Schoen et al. ( _B-1_ ).


For undersaturated conditions, directional vehicle delay caused by a
two-lane highway work zone with one lane closed can be represented by
Equation 26-B15


**Equation 26-B15:**


where

_d_ = control delay per passenger car (s/pc),

_d_ 1 = uniform control delay assuming uniform traffic arrivals (s/pc), and


_d_ 2 = incremental delay resulting from random arrivals and
oversaturation queues (s/pc).


For each direction _i_, the total directional uniform control delay per cycle
_Di_,1 (in seconds) is the triangle area in the queue length diagram (Exhibit 26B7). It is calculated as one-half the queue length multiplied by the queueing
duration. _Di_,1 is given by Equation 26-B16.


**Equation 26-B16:**


The average uniform delay in direction _i_ is given by Equation 26-B17.


**Equation 26-B17:**


Finally, by following Equation 19-26 in Chapter 19, the average
incremental delay in direction _i_ is given by Equation 26-B18.


**Equation 26-B18:**


where

_T_ = analysis period duration (h),

_k_ = incremental delay factor (decimal),

_I_ = upstream filtering adjustment factor (decimal),


_ci_ = directional capacity (pc/h) from Equation 26-B11, and

_Xi_ = directional volume-to-capacity ratio or degree of saturation
(unitless).


Values for _k c_ an be calculated with Equation 19-22 in Chapter 19. For
fixed-time control, _k_ = 0.5. Because the purpose of calculating delay in a
work zone context is to identify the optimal effective green time, which is
assumed to repeat every cycle, a value for _k_ of 0.5 is recommended for use in
Equation 26-B18. It incorporates the effects of metered arrivals from
upstream signals or work zones. If the work zone is isolated, then _I_ = 1.0.

The average delay per passenger car is the sum of the directional total
delays, divided by the total number of passenger cars, as shown in Equation
26-B19. Note that the traffic flow rates used in the equation are in units of
passenger cars per hour; therefore, vehicle delay is calculated in terms of
seconds per passenger car.


**Equation 26-B19:**


In equations calculating queue length and vehicle delay, all variables are
given by roadway or traffic parameters, except that directional effective
green time _Gi_ should be determined by users. Thus users can change the
traffic control plan to optimize the result. Users must note, however, that they
should not arbitrarily choose an effective green-time value.


**EXAMPLE CALCULATION**

This subsection presents an example application of the methodology. An
isolated 1,000-ft-long work zone will be located on a rural two-lane
highway. Known peak hour roadway and traffic parameters are summarized
in Exhibit 26-B8 and Exhibit 26-B9.


**Exhibit 26-B8: Example Calculation: Work Zone Roadway Parameters**


**Direction** **Lane** **Shoulder** **No. of Access Points per** **General Terrain**


**Width** **Width** **Mile** **Type**
**(ft)** **(ft)**

**1** 12 3 0 Rolling
**2** 12 3 0 Rolling


**Exhibit 26-B9: Example Calculation: Work Zone Traffic Parameters**


**Speed Limit** **Traffic Demand**
**Direction** **(mi/h)** **(veh/h)** **PHF** **Truck Percentage** **RV Percentage**

**1** 45 300 0.88 10.0 10.0
**2** 45 300 0.88 10.0 10.0


**Step 1: Collect Data**

Most of the necessary data are provided in the problem statement.
However, the traffic demand _Vi_ (in vehicles per hour) must be converted into
a traffic flow rate _vi_ (in passenger cars per hour).


This equation requires determining both an adjustment factor for grade
(in this case, general terrain) and an adjustment factor for heavy vehicles
(which also includes terrain effects). In addition, a peak hour factor (PHF) is
applied; this was given in the problem statement as 0.88 for each direction.

From Exhibit 26-B2, the grade adjustment factor _fg_ for rolling terrain is
0.83, while from Exhibit 26-B4, the truck PCE is 2.1 and the RV PCE is 1.1.
The heavy vehicle adjustment factor _fHV_ can then be calculated from
Equation 26-B2.


then


**Step 2: Estimate Average Travel Speed**

Average travel speed through the work zone is calculated with Equation
26-B3 and Equation 26-B4 for Directions 1 and 2, respectively.


The speed limit _Spl_ is given. From Equation 15-5, the adjustment for lane
and shoulder width _fLS_ for 12-ft lane widths and 3-ft shoulder widths is as
follows:


Finally, from Equation 15-6, the adjustment for access point density is
0.0 mi/h when no access points are present. Then


**Step 3: Estimate Saturation Flow Rate**

Equation 26-B5 through Equation 26-B7 are used to estimate the
saturation flow rate through the work zone.

First, the speed adjustment factor is calculated for each direction as
follows:


Next, an adjusted time headway is calculated for each direction as
follows:


where the base saturation headway of 1.89 s/pc is as given in the text
following Equation 26-B6.

Finally, the saturation flow rate for each direction is calculated as


**Step 4: Estimate Green Time**

In Step 4, the effective green time length is determined. It may be difficult
to choose a green time value without knowing the traffic performance
parameters, but an estimate of the optimal value can be obtained with
Equation 26-B8.


As the work zone will be 1,000 ft long, the value 0.0375 _l_ computes to
37.5 s. As 37.5 is between 20 and 60, it can be used directly; however, this
value should be checked to make sure it is long enough to discharge the
vehicle queues. Equation 26-B9 provides this check.


The cycle length _C_ is computed from Equation 26-B10, incorporating a
default value of 2.0 s for the start-up lost time.


then


As the optimal effective green time of 37.5 s is greater than the minimum
required time for each direction, it is accepted, and the process continues to
Step 5.


**Step 5: Calculate Capacity**

Directional capacity is calculated with Equation 26-B11.


As _v_ 1 < _c_ 1 and _v_ 2 < _c_ 2, this 1,000-ft work zone can serve the traffic
demand without accumulating vehicle queues when the effective green time is
37.5 s for both directions.


**Queuing and Delay**

If desired, the maximum queue length and average vehicle delay can be
calculated for both directions. The maximum queue length is calculated from
Equation 26-B13 and Equation 26-B14 for Directions 1 and 2, respectively.


The average uniform delay by direction is calculated with Equation 26B17.


The average incremental delay by direction is calculated from Equation
26-B18 The recommended value of 0.5 is used for the incremental delay
factor _k_, and as the work zone is isolated, a value of 1.0 is used for the
upstream filtering adjustment factor _I_ .


Finally, the average delay per passenger car is given by Equation 26B19.
