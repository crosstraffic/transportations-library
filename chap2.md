# **1. INTRODUCTION**

**OVERVIEW**

Applications of the _Highway Capacity Manual_ (HCM) range from the
highly detailed to the highly generalized. The HCM can be applied to
roadway system elements varying from individual points to an entire
transportation system, to a number of travel modes that can be considered
separately or in combination, and to several types of roadway and facility
operating conditions. This chapter introduces the wide range of potential
HCM applications. It also introduces the travel modes and roadway
operating conditions to which the HCM can be applied.

The HCM can be applied at the _operational, design, preliminary_
_engineering,_ and _planning_ analysis levels. The required input data typically
remain the same at each analysis level, but the degree to which analysis
inputs use default values instead of actual measured or forecast values
differs. In addition, operational analyses and planning and preliminary
engineering analyses frequently evaluate the level of service (LOS) that will
result from a given set of inputs, whereas design analyses typically determine
which facility characteristics will be needed to achieve a desired LOS.

The travel modes covered by the HCM include _motorized vehicles_

[consisting of automobiles, light and heavy trucks, recreational vehicles
(RVs), buses, and motorcycles], _pedestrians,_ and _bicycles._ Some chapters
also provide methods specific to _trucks_ (e.g., single-unit trucks, tractortrailers) and _public transit_ vehicles operating on urban streets. The HCM’s
motorized vehicle methods assess the overall operation and quality of
service of a traffic stream composed of a mix of vehicle types, while the
truck and transit methods specifically address the operation (and, for transit,
quality of service) of those modes.

All of these modes operate on a variety of roadway system elements,
including _points_ (e.g., intersections); _segments_ (e.g., lengths of roadways
between intersections); _facilities_ (aggregations of points and segments);


_corridors_ (parallel freeway and urban street facilities); _networks_ (a facility
and a set of connecting facilities); and, at the largest geographic scales, _areas_
and _systems._

HCM methodologies are provided both for _uninterrupted-flow_ facilities,
which have no fixed causes of delay or interruption external to the traffic
stream, and for _interrupted-flow_ facilities, on which traffic control devices
such as traffic signals and STOP signs periodically interrupt the traffic stream.
HCM analyses are applicable to _undersaturated_ conditions (where demand
is less than a roadway system element’s capacity) and, in certain situations,
to _oversaturated_ conditions (where demand exceeds capacity).

Finally, measures generated by HCM methodologies can be used for
more than just stand-alone traffic analyses. This chapter describes potential
applications of HCM methodologies to noise, air quality, economic, and
multimodal planning analyses.

# **2. LEVELS OF ANALYSIS**

**OVERVIEW**

Any given roadway operations analysis can be performed at different
levels of detail, depending on the purpose of the analysis and the amount of
information available. Typically, as an analysis becomes more detailed, its
data requirements increase, the analysis area shrinks, the time requirements
increase, and the degree of precision in the estimated performance improves
( _1_ ).

The HCM defines three primary levels of analysis. From the most to the
least detailed, these are as follows:

   - _Operational analysis_ typically focuses on current or near-term
conditions. It involves detailed inputs to HCM procedures, with no or
minimal use of default values.

   - _Design analysis_ typically uses HCM procedures to identify the
characteristics of a transportation facility that will allow it to operate
at a desired LOS, with some use of default values.

   - _Planning_ and _preliminary engineering analyses_ typically focus on
initial problem identification, long-range analyses, and performance
monitoring applications, where many facilities or alternatives must
be evaluated quickly or when specific input values to procedures are
not known. The extensive use of default values is required.

The typical usage of each of these analysis levels is described in the
following subsections.


**OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS**

Operational analyses are applications of the HCM generally oriented
toward current or near-term conditions. They aim at providing information
for decisions on whether there is a need for improvements to an existing


point, segment, or facility. Occasionally, an analysis is made to determine
whether a more extensive planning study is needed. Sometimes the focus is
on a network, or part of one, that is approaching oversaturation or an
undesirable LOS: When, in the near term, is the facility likely to fail (or fail
to meet a desired LOS threshold)? To answer this question, an estimate of the
service flow rate allowable under a specified LOS is required.

HCM analyses also help practitioners make decisions about operating
conditions. Typical alternatives often involve the analysis of appropriate
lane configurations, alternative traffic control devices, signal timing and
phasing, spacing and location of bus stops, frequency of bus service, and
addition of a managed (e.g., high-occupancy vehicle) lane or a bicycle lane.
The analysis produces operational measures for a comparison of the
alternatives.

Because of the short-term focus of operational analyses, detailed inputs
can be provided to the models. Many of the inputs may be based on field
measurements of traffic, physical features, and control parameters. Generally,
the use of default values at this level of analysis is inappropriate.


**DESIGN ANALYSIS**

Design analyses primarily apply the HCM to establish the detailed
physical features that will allow a new or modified facility to operate at a
desired LOS. Design projects are usually targeted for mid- to long-term
implementation. Not all the physical features that a designer must determine
are reflected in the HCM models. Typically, analysts using the HCM seek to
determine such elements as the basic number of lanes required and the need
for auxiliary or turning lanes. However, an analyst can also use the HCM to
establish values for elements such as lane width, steepness of grade, length
of added lanes, size of pedestrian queuing areas, widths of sidewalks and
walkways, and presence of bus turnouts.

The data required for design analyses are fairly detailed and are based
substantially on proposed design attributes. However, the intermediate- to
long-term focus of the work will require use of some default values. This
simplification is justified in part by the limits on the accuracy and precision
of the traffic predictions with which the analyst is working.


**PLANNING AND PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING ANALYSES**

Planning analyses are applications of the HCM generally directed toward
broad issues such as initial problem identification (e.g., screening a large
number of locations for potential operations deficiencies), long-range
analyses, and regional and statewide performance monitoring. An analyst
often must estimate when the operation of the current and committed systems
will fall below a desired LOS. Preliminary engineering analyses are often
conducted to support planning decisions related to roadway design concept
and scope and when alternatives analyses are performed. These studies can
also assess proposed systemic policies, such as lane use control for heavy
vehicles, systemwide freeway ramp metering and other intelligent
transportation system applications, and the use of demand management
techniques (e.g., congestion pricing) ( _2_ ).

Planning and preliminary engineering analyses typically involve
situations in which not all of the data needed for the analysis are available.
Therefore, both types of analyses frequently rely on default values for many
analysis inputs. Planning analyses may default nearly all inputs—for
example, through the use of generalized service volume tables. Preliminary
engineering analyses will typically fall between planning and design
analyses in the use of default values.


**MATCHING THE ANALYSIS TOOL TO THE ANALYSIS LEVEL**

Each methodological chapter in Volumes 2 and 3 has one core
computational methodology. The degree to which defaulted or assumed
values are used as inputs determines whether the HCM method is being
applied at an operational, design, preliminary engineering, or planning level.
However, the basic computational steps are the same regardless of the
analysis level.

Some planning analyses (e.g., a long-range planning study where many
input values, such as forecast volumes, are uncertain) may not require the
level of precision provided by a core HCM methodology. Other kinds of
planning analyses (e.g., sketch planning) may need to evaluate a large number
of alternatives quickly. In either case, the analysis objective is to make a
rough determination of whether a roadway facility will perform adequately
rather than to estimate a particular performance characteristic, such as speed


or delay, precisely. For these situations, the HCM and its companion
_Planning and Preliminary Engineering Applications Guide to the HCM_ ( _1_ )
provide tools (e.g., service volume tables, quick estimation methods) that
require less input data and fewer calculations, and they produce
correspondingly less precise results.

Some operational analyses may require more detail (e.g., minute-byminute roadway operations, evaluation of individual vehicle performance)
than HCM methods are designed to produce. In other cases, a limitation of an
HCM method may make its use inappropriate for a given analysis. In these
situations, an analyst will need to apply an alternative analysis tool to
complete the analysis.

Chapter 6, HCM and Alternative Analysis Tools, describes the range of
HCM-based and alternative analysis tools available for analyzing roadway
operations and quality of service and provides guidance on selecting an
appropriate tool to meet a particular analysis need.


# **3. ROADWAY SYSTEM ELEMENTS**

**TYPES OF ROADWAY SYSTEM ELEMENTS**

The HCM defines seven main types of roadway system elements. From
smallest to largest, the elements are points, segments, facilities, corridors,
networks, areas, and systems. The focus of the HCM is on points, segments,
and facilities. Exhibit 2-1 illustrates the spatial relationships of these
elements, and the following sections provide details about each system
element type.


**Exhibit 2-1: Illustrative Roadway System Elements**


(a) Points, Segments, Facilities, Corridors, and Networks


(b) Corridors, Networks, Areas, and Systems


**Points**

Points are places along a facility where ( _a_ ) conflicting traffic streams
cross, merge, or diverge; ( _b_ ) a single traffic stream is regulated by a traffic
control device; or ( _c_ ) there is a significant change in the segment capacity
(e.g., lane drop, lane addition, narrow bridge, significant upgrade, start or
end of a ramp influence area).

Some points, such as interchange ramp terminals, may actually have a
significant physical length associated with them, as suggested by Exhibit 21(a). For urban street facility analysis, points are treated as having zero
length—all of the delay occurs at the point. For freeway facility analysis,
points are used to define the endpoints of segments, but they have no
associated performance measures or capacity, since these items are
calculated at the segment level.


**Segments**

A segment is the length of roadway between two points. Traffic volumes
and physical characteristics generally remain the same over the length of a


segment, although small variations may occur (e.g., changes in traffic
volumes on a segment resulting from a low-volume driveway). Segments may
or may not be directional. The HCM defines basic freeway and multilane
highway segments, freeway weaving segments, freeway merge and diverge
segments, two-lane highway segments, and urban street segments.


**Facilities**

Facilities are lengths of roadways, bicycle paths, and pedestrian
walkways composed of a connected series of points and segments. Facilities
may or may not be directional and are defined by two endpoints. The HCM
defines freeway facilities, two-lane highway facilities, urban street facilities,
and pedestrian and bicycle facilities.


**Corridors**

Corridors are generally a set of parallel transportation facilities. For
example, a corridor may consist of a freeway facility and one or more
parallel urban street facilities. There may also be rail or bus transit service
on the freeway, the urban streets, or both, and transit service could be
provided within a separate, parallel right-of-way. Pedestrian or bicycle
facilities may also be present within the corridor as designated portions of
roadways and as exclusive, parallel facilities.


**Networks**

Networks consist of a specified facility and a set of facilities connecting
to it, which can be freeways, urban streets, or both. The HCM uses network
analysis to evaluate the effects of spillback from one facility to another.


**Areas**

Areas consist of an interconnected set of transportation facilities serving
movements within a specified geographic space as well as movements to and
from adjoining areas. Area boundaries can be set by significant
transportation facilities, political boundaries, or topographic features such as
ridgelines or major bodies of water.


**Systems**

Systems are composed of all the transportation facilities and modes
within a particular region. A large metropolitan area system typically has
multiple corridors within it, which divide the region into a number of smaller
areas. Each area contains a number of facilities, which, in turn, are
composed of a series of points and segments. Systems can also be divided
into modal subsystems (e.g., the roadway system, the transit system) and into
subsystems composed of specific roadway elements (e.g., the freeway
system, the urban street system).


**ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM ELEMENTS**

The HCM provides tools to help analysts estimate performance measures
for individual elements of a multimodal transportation system, as well as
guidance on combining those elements to evaluate larger systems. Exhibit 2-2
tabulates the various system elements for which the HCM provides analysis
methodologies in Volumes 2 and 3, the service measure(s) used to determine
LOS for each mode operating on each system element, and the HCM
performance measure that can be used to aggregate results to a system level.
Some combinations of system elements and travel modes unite several
performance measures into a single traveler perception model that is used to
generate a LOS score; the components of each model are listed in Exhibit 23.

_b_ See Exhibit 2-3 for the LOS score components.
_c_ Events are situations where pedestrians meet bicyclists.


**ASSESSMENT OF MULTIPLE FACILITIES**

The analysis of a transportation system starts with estimates of delay at
the point and segment levels. Point delays arise from the effects of traffic
control devices such as traffic signals and STOP signs. Segment delays
combine the point delay incurred at the end of the segment with other delays
incurred within the segment. Examples of the latter include delays caused by
midblock turning activity into driveways, parking activity, and midblock
pedestrian crossings. The HCM estimates segment speed instead of segment
delay; however, segment speed can be converted into segment delay by using
Equation 2-1.

**Equation 2-1:**


where

_Di_ = person-hours of delay on segment _i,_

_AVOi_ = average vehicle occupancy on segment _i_ (passengers/vehicle),

_di_ = vehicle demand on segment _i_ (vehicles),

_Li_ = length of segment _i_ (mi),


_Si_ = average vehicle speed on segment _i_ (mi/h), and

_S_ 0 _i_ = free-flow speed of segment _i_ (mi/h).


Segment delays are added together to obtain facility estimates, and the
sum of the facility estimates yields subsystem estimates. Mean delays for
each subsystem are then computed by dividing the total person-hours of delay
by the total number of trips on the subsystem. Subsystem estimates of delay
can be combined into total system estimates, but typically the results for each
subsystem are reported separately.


**SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT**

System performance must be measured in more than one dimension.
When a single intersection is analyzed, computation of only the peak-period
delay may suffice; however, when a system is analyzed, the geographic
extent, the duration of delay, and any shifts in demand among facilities and
modes must also be considered ( _3_ ).

System performance can be measured in the following six dimensions:

   - _Quantity of service_ —the number of person miles and person-hours
provided by the system,

   - _Intensity of congestion_ —the amount of congestion experienced by
users of the system,

   - _Duration of congestion_ —the number of hours that congestion
persists,

   - _Extent of congestion_ —the physical length of the congested system,

   - _Variability_ —the day-to-day variation in congestion, and

   - _Accessibility_ —the percentage of the populace able to complete a
selected trip within a specified time.


**Quantity of Service**

Quantity of service measures the utilization of the transportation system
in terms of the number of people using the system, the distance they travel
(person miles of travel, PMT), and the time they require to travel (person

hours of travel, PHT). Dividing the PMT by the PHT gives the mean trip
speed for the system.


**Intensity of Congestion**

The intensity of congestion can be measured by using total person-hours
of delay and mean trip speed. Other metrics, such as mean delay per person
trip, can also be used. In planning and preliminary engineering applications,
intensity of congestion is sometimes measured in terms of the volume-tocapacity ratio or the demand-to-capacity ratio.


**Duration of Congestion**

The duration of congestion is measured in terms of the maximum amount
of time that congestion occurs anywhere in the system. A segment is
congested if the demand exceeds the segment’s discharge capacity. Transit
subsystem congestion can occur either when the passenger demand exceeds
the capacity of the transit vehicles or when the need to move transit vehicles
exceeds the vehicular capacity of the transit facility.


**Extent of Congestion**

The extent of congestion may be expressed in terms of the directional
miles of facilities congested or—more meaningfully for the public—in terms
of the maximum percentage of system miles congested at any one time.


**Variability**

Variability of congestion is expressed by measures of travel time
reliability, including measures of travel time variability and measures of a
given trip’s success or failure in meeting a target travel time. Section 2 of
Chapter 4, Traffic Operations and Capacity Concepts, discusses travel time
reliability in detail.


**Accessibility**

Accessibility examines the effectiveness of the system from a perspective
other than intensity. Accessibility can be expressed in terms of the percentage


of trips (or persons) able to accomplish a certain goal—such as going from
home to work—within a targeted travel time. Accessibility can also be
defined in terms of a traveler’s ability to get to and use a particular modal
subsystem, such as transit. This definition is closer to the Americans with
Disabilities Act’s use of the term.


# **4. TRAVEL MODES**

This section introduces the four major travel modes addressed by the
HCM: automobile, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit. Chapter 3, Modal
Characteristics, provides details about each mode that are important for
HCM analyses.


**MOTORIZED VEHICLE MODE**

The motorized vehicle mode includes all motor vehicle traffic using a
roadway. Thus, automobiles, trucks, RVs, motorcycles, and public transit
buses are all considered members of the motorized vehicle mode for HCM
analysis purposes. Because different motor vehicle types have different
operating characteristics (to be discussed further in Chapter 3), the HCM
uses the passenger car as a common basis of comparison. For example,
trucks take up more roadway space than passenger cars and accelerate more
slowly, particularly on upgrades. Therefore, in some cases, the HCM
converts trucks into passenger car equivalents (e.g., an average truck uses the
same roadway space as two passenger cars on a freeway with a level grade);
in other cases, parameters used by HCM methods are adjusted to reflect the
specific mix of vehicles in the traffic stream.

The HCM’s LOS thresholds for the motorized vehicle mode are based on
the perspective of automobile drivers. Therefore, automobile LOS measures
may not reflect the perspective of drivers of other types of motorized
vehicles, especially trucks. The HCM defines a separate _transit mode_ to
present LOS measures for public transit passengers.

Analytical methods and performance measures that specifically describe
truck operations and quality of service are a growing area of research and
transportation agency interest. This edition of the HCM occasionally uses a
separate _truck mode_ to present truck-specific information; however, in most
cases, trucks are analyzed as part of the motorized vehicle mode.


**PEDESTRIAN MODE**

The pedestrian mode consists of travelers along a roadway or pedestrian
facility making a journey (or at least part of their journey) on foot.
Pedestrians walk at different speeds, depending on their age, their ability,
and environmental characteristics (e.g., grades and climate); HCM
procedures generally account for this variability. Sidewalks and pathways
may be used by more than just foot-based traffic—for example, inline skaters
and persons in wheelchairs—but the HCM’s LOS thresholds reflect the
perspective of persons making a walking journey.


**BICYCLE MODE**

The bicycle mode consists of travelers on a roadway or pathway who are
using a nonmotorized bicycle for their trip; bicycle LOS thresholds reflect
their perspective. Mopeds and motorized scooters are not considered
bicycles for HCM analysis purposes.


**TRANSIT MODE**

Urban roadways are often shared with public transit buses and,
occasionally, with rail transit vehicles such as streetcars and light rail
vehicles. The HCM’s urban street facility and segment chapters (Chapters 16
and 18) provide methods for assessing the quality of service of transit
service from the passenger point of view. The companion _Transit Capacity_
_and Quality of Service Manual_ (TCQSM) ( _4_ ) provides methods for
assessing the capacity, speed, and quality of service of a variety of transit
modes in both on- and off-street settings.


# **5. OPERATING CONDITIONS**

The HCM provides methods for analyzing traffic flow under a variety of
conditions. These conditions are introduced and defined in this section, since
they are used repeatedly throughout the HCM. They are described more fully
in Chapter 4, Traffic Operations and Capacity Concepts.


**UNINTERRUPTED FLOW**

Uninterrupted-flow facilities have no fixed causes of delay or
interruption external to the traffic stream. Volume 2 of the HCM provides
analysis methodologies for uninterrupted-flow facilities.

Freeways and their components operate under the purest form of
uninterrupted flow. There are no fixed interruptions to traffic flow, and
access is controlled and limited to ramp locations. Multilane highways and
two-lane highways can also operate under uninterrupted flow in long
segments between points of fixed interruption. On multilane and two-lane
highways, points of fixed interruption (e.g., traffic signals) as well as
uninterrupted-flow segments must often be examined.

The traffic stream on uninterrupted-flow facilities is the result of
individual vehicles interacting with each other and the facility’s geometric
characteristics. The pattern of flow is generally controlled only by the
characteristics of the land uses that generate traffic using the facility, although
freeway management and operations strategies—such as ramp metering,
freeway auxiliary lanes, truck lane restrictions, variable speed limits, and
incident detection and clearance—can influence traffic flow. Operations can
also be affected by environmental conditions, such as weather or lighting; by
pavement conditions; by work zones; and by the occurrence of traffic
incidents ( _5_, _6_ ).

_Uninterrupted flow_ describes the type of facility, not the quality of the
traffic flow at any given time. The terms _oversaturated_ and _undersaturated_
_flow,_ described below, reflect the quality of traffic flow. An oversaturated


freeway is still an uninterrupted-flow facility because the causes of
congestion are internal.


**INTERRUPTED FLOW**

Interrupted-flow facilities have fixed causes of periodic delay or
interruption to the traffic stream, such as traffic signals, roundabouts, and

STOP signs. Urban streets are the most common form of this kind of facility.
Exclusive pedestrian and bicycle facilities are also treated as interrupted
flow, since they may occasionally intersect other streets at locations where
pedestrians and bicyclists do not automatically receive the right-of-way.
Volume 3 of the HCM provides analysis methodologies for interrupted-flow
facilities.

The traffic flow patterns on an interrupted-flow facility are the result not
only of vehicle interactions and the facility’s geometric characteristics but
also of the traffic control used at intersections and the frequency of access
points to the facility. Traffic signals, for example, allow designated
movements to occur only during certain portions of the signal cycle (and,
therefore, only during certain portions of an hour). This control creates two
significant outcomes. First, time becomes a factor affecting flow and capacity
because the facility is not available for continuous use. Second, the traffic
flow pattern is dictated by the type of control used. For instance, traffic
signals create platoons of vehicles that travel along the facility as a group,
with significant gaps between one platoon and the next. In contrast, all-way

STOP-controlled intersections and roundabouts discharge vehicles more
randomly, creating small (but not necessarily usable) gaps in traffic at
downstream locations ( _5_, _7_ ).


**UNDERSATURATED FLOW**

Traffic flow during an analysis period (e.g., 15 min) is specified as
_undersaturated_ when the following conditions are satisfied: ( _a_ ) the arrival
flow rate is lower than the capacity of a point or segment, ( _b_ ) no residual
queue remains from a prior breakdown of the facility, and ( _c_ ) traffic flow is
unaffected by downstream conditions.

Uninterrupted-flow facilities operating in a state of undersaturated flow
will typically have travel speeds within 10% to 20% of the facility’s free

flow speed, even at high flow rates, under base conditions (e.g., level
grades, standard lane widths, good weather, no incidents). Furthermore, no
queues would be expected to develop on the facility.

On interrupted-flow facilities, queues form as a natural consequence of
the interruptions to traffic flow created by traffic signals and STOP and YIELD
signs. Therefore, travel speeds are typically 30% to 65% below the facility’s
free-flow speed in undersaturated conditions. Individual cycle failures—
where a vehicle has to wait through more than one green phase to be served
—may occur at traffic signals under moderate- to high-volume conditions as
a result of natural variations in the cycle-to-cycle arrival and service rate.
Similarly, stoP- and YIELD-controlled approaches may experience short
periods of significant queue buildup. However, as long as all of the demand
on an intersection approach is served within a 15-min analysis period,
including any residual demand from the prior period, the approach is
considered to be undersaturated.


**OVERSATURATED FLOW**

Traffic flow during an analysis period is characterized as _oversaturated_
when any of the following conditions is satisfied: ( _a_ ) the arrival flow rate
exceeds the capacity of a point or segment, ( _b_ ) a queue created from a prior
breakdown of a facility has not yet dissipated, or ( _c_ ) traffic flow is affected
by downstream conditions.

On uninterrupted-flow facilities, oversaturated conditions result from a
bottleneck on the facility. During periods of oversaturation, queues form and
extend backward from the bottleneck point. Traffic speeds and flows drop
significantly as a result of turbulence, and they can vary considerably,
depending on the severity of the bottleneck. Freeway queues differ from
queues at undersaturated signalized intersections in that they are not static or
“standing.” On freeways, vehicles move slowly through a queue, with
periods of stopping and movement. Even after the demand at the back of the
queue drops, some time is required for the queue to dissipate because
vehicles discharge from the queue at a slower rate than they do under freeflow conditions. Oversaturated conditions persist within the queue until the
queue dissipates completely after a period of time during which demand
flows are less than the capacity of the bottleneck.


On interrupted-flow facilities, oversaturated conditions generate a queue
that grows backward from the intersection at a rate faster than can be
processed by the intersection over the analysis period. Oversaturated
conditions persist after demand drops below capacity until the residual
queue (i.e., the queue over and above what would be created by the
intersection’s traffic control) has dissipated. A queue generated by an
oversaturated unsignalized intersection dissipates more gradually than is
typically possible at a signalized intersection.

If an intersection approach or ramp meter cannot accommodate all of its
demand, queues may back into upstream intersections and adversely affect
their performance. Similarly, if an interchange ramp terminal cannot
accommodate all of its demand, queues may back onto the freeway and
adversely affect the freeway’s performance.


**QUEUE DISCHARGE FLOW**

A third type of flow, queue discharge flow, is particularly relevant for
uninterrupted-flow facilities. Queue discharge flow represents traffic flow
that has just passed through a bottleneck and, in the absence of another
bottleneck downstream, is accelerating back to the facility’s free-flow speed.
Queue discharge flow is characterized by relatively stable flow as long as
the effects of another bottleneck downstream are not present.

On freeways, this flow type is typically characterized by speeds ranging
from 35 mi/h up to the free-flow speed of the freeway segment. Lower
speeds are typically observed just downstream of the bottleneck. Depending
on horizontal and vertical alignments, queue discharge flow usually
accelerates back to the facility’s free-flow speed within 0.5 to 1 mi
downstream of the bottleneck. The queue discharge flow rate from the
bottleneck is lower than the maximum flows observed before breakdown;
this effect is discussed further in Section 2 of Chapter 10, Freeway Facilities
Core Methodology.


# **6. HCM ANALYSIS AS PART OF A BROADER** **PROCESS**

Since its first edition in 1950, the HCM has provided transportation
analysts with tools for estimating traffic operational measures such as speed,
density, and delay. It also has provided insights and specific tools for
estimating the effects of traffic, roadway, and other conditions on the capacity
of facilities. Over time, calculated values from the HCM have increasingly
been used in other transportation work. The use of estimated or calculated
values from HCM work as the foundation for estimating user costs and
benefits in terms of economic value and environmental changes (especially
air and noise) is particularly pronounced in transportation priority programs
and in the justification of projects. This section provides examples of how
HCM outputs can be used as inputs to other types of analyses.


**NOISE ANALYSIS**

At the time this chapter was written, federal regulations specifying noise
abatement criteria stated that “in predicting noise levels and assessing noise
impacts, traffic characteristics which will yield the worst hourly traffic noise
impact on a regular basis for the design year shall be used” [23 CFR
772.17(b)]. The “worst hour” is usually taken to mean the loudest hour,
which does not necessarily coincide with the busiest hour, since vehicular
noise levels are directly related to speed. Traffic conditions in which large
trucks are at their daily peak and in which LOS E conditions exist typically
represent the loudest hour ( _8_ ).


**AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS**

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required state and local agencies
to develop accurate emission inventories as an integral part of their air
quality management and transportation planning responsibilities. Vehicular
emissions are a significant contributor to poor air quality; therefore, the U.S.


Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed analysis procedures
and tools for estimating emissions from mobile sources such as motorized
vehicles. One input into the emissions model is average vehicle speed, which
can be entered at the link (i.e., length between successive ramps) level, if
desired. EPA’s model is sensitive to average vehicle speed (i.e., a 20%
change in average vehicle speed resulted in a greater than 20% change in the
emissions estimate), which implies that accurate speed inputs are a
requirement for accurate emissions estimates. The HCM is a tool
recommended by EPA for generating speed estimates on freeways and
arterials and collectors ( _9_ - _11_ ).


**ECONOMIC ANALYSIS**

The economic analysis of transportation improvements also depends to a
large extent on information generated from the HCM. Road user benefits are
directly related to reductions in travel time and delay, while costs are
determined from construction of roadway improvements (e.g., addition of
lanes, installation of traffic signals) and increases in travel time and delay.


**MULTIMODAL PLANNING ANALYSIS**

An increasing number of jurisdictions are taking an integrated approach
to multimodal transportation planning. That is, rather than developing plans
for the automobile, transit, and pedestrian and bicycle modes in isolation,
these jurisdictions evaluate trade-offs among the modes as part of their
transportation planning and decision making. The HCM is designed to
support those efforts. For example, Chapter 16, Urban Street Facilities,
presents an integrated, multimodal set of LOS measures for urban streets. The
other interrupted-flow chapters in Volume 3 also integrate pedestrian and
bicycle measures, to the extent that research is available to support those
measures.


**SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT**

State and federal governments use HCM procedures in reporting and
forecasting transportation system performance. For example, the Federal
Highway Administration’s Highway Performance Monitoring System uses
HCM procedures to estimate the capacity of highway sections and to


determine volume-to-service flow ratios ( _12_ ). In addition, two federal
surface transportation funding acts, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the
21st Century (MAP-21) Act and the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act, established performance-based procedures for planning and
project programming ( _13_ ). The HCM’s travel time and reliability estimation
procedures can be used to forecast future roadway performance resulting
from various operations and infrastructure strategies under consideration.
Florida uses HCM procedures to estimate speeds on the state highway
system as part of its mobility performance measures reporting.


**SUMMARY**

In summary, almost all economic analyses and all air and noise
environmental analyses rely directly on one or more measures estimated or
produced with HCM calculations. Exhibit 2-4 lists the motorized vehicle–
based performance measures from this manual that are applicable to
environmental or economic analyses.
